09/06/2021, 13:16 - Gracou: She told me when I was leaving that she had thrown up 5 times while everyone was there
09/06/2021, 13:16 - Gracou: How was your night?
09/06/2021, 13:17 - Théodore Bedos: Ahaha that's a record not easy to beat

09/06/2021, 13:17 - Théodore Bedos: and in a single bed too
09/06/2021, 13:17 - Gracou: Yeah but it wasn’t bc she was drunk she was just actually unwell
09/06/2021, 13:18 - Gracou: Me too
09/06/2021, 13:18 - Gracou: I couldn’t fall asleep on the first night I found it so weird
09/06/2021, 13:19 - Théodore Bedos: I woke up in the middle of the night quiet pissed, and asked you at loud why were you not wanting to hug me because I thaught you were here
09/06/2021, 13:19 - Gracou: Awwwww🥺🥺🥺
09/06/2021, 13:19 - Gracou: That’s so cute

09/06/2021, 13:20 - Gracou: Ow I’m sorry :(
09/06/2021, 13:20 - Gracou: That’s not stupid it’s rlly sweet
09/06/2021, 13:21 - Théodore Bedos: I saw that you saw Bea and Tobs the other day, how was it?
09/06/2021, 13:21 - Gracou: That was when we found the really yummy Thai place
09/06/2021, 13:21 - Gracou: It was fun :) we had just toured our house for next year
09/06/2021, 13:22 - Théodore Bedos: How long will they stay in Bath?
09/06/2021, 13:22 - Gracou: It’s quite a big house tho I’m not sure which room I want
09/06/2021, 13:22 - Gracou: Béa is leaving sort of soon bc she has a placement in london that starts in august so she wants to see her family and friends in Sweden first
09/06/2021, 13:23 - Gracou: Im leaving next Thursday which is when everyone else seems to be going
09/06/2021, 13:23 - Gracou: How u been out much since u got home?
09/06/2021, 13:27 - Théodore Bedos: I have been doing a lot of cleaning and emailing
09/06/2021, 13:28 - Théodore Bedos: because I have some visa stuff, and loan issues to sort out
09/06/2021, 13:28 - Théodore Bedos: But I already fill a bit borred
09/06/2021, 13:28 - Théodore Bedos: Not because it's Paris but because I don't feel like I am very energetic in my parent house
09/06/2021, 13:31 - Gracou: Im currently bored too
09/06/2021, 13:32 - Gracou: Why don’t u feel energetic at ur parents
09/06/2021, 13:33 - Théodore Bedos: Their are too many sofas, beds etc... And not a proper big and empty desk to work
09/06/2021, 13:34 - Théodore Bedos: Also I am always here in holliday and with my parents I feel less independant
09/06/2021, 13:36 - Gracou: Haha too many sofas
09/06/2021, 13:36 - Gracou: I understand
09/06/2021, 13:36 - Gracou: Well I probs need to decide what it is that u want to do w ur summer
09/06/2021, 13:37 - Gracou: U*
09/06/2021, 13:38 - Théodore Bedos: What we want to do?
09/06/2021, 13:41 - Théodore Bedos: I was thinking of inviting you earlier so that you can be there to see the day of music in Paris, but they cancelled it
09/06/2021, 13:49 - Gracou: No no I meant what it is that u want to do so u won’t be so bored x
09/06/2021, 13:49 - Gracou: That’s a shame that they cancelled it
09/06/2021, 13:49 - Gracou: Especially since it happened last year😂
09/06/2021, 14:01 - Théodore Bedos: It's not fully cancelled, they allow sitting planned concerts. Which is the opposit of the spirit, normally it is soo good because it is soo wild. Everyone is allowed to play music everywhere and so wild concerts appears here and there. You just walk through Paris from one concert to another
09/06/2021, 14:01 - Théodore Bedos: sad
09/06/2021, 14:02 - Théodore Bedos: You'll have to support me one more year if you want to come see it with me
09/06/2021, 14:07 - Gracou: I don’t have a problem with that
09/06/2021, 15:29 - Gracou: Although you’re going to have to put up with me being away on placement
09/06/2021, 16:36 - Théodore Bedos: What do you mean by that?
09/06/2021, 17:09 - Gracou: Well if I’m going to support u for a whole year
09/06/2021, 17:26 - Gracou: Did I upset u?
09/06/2021, 18:09 - Théodore Bedos: No no I was just doing placement applications and I just didn't understand what you said about your placement thing.
09/06/2021, 18:11 - Gracou: Ah don’t worry about it
09/06/2021, 18:11 - Gracou: Good luck with your applications
09/06/2021, 19:32 - Théodore Bedos: tell me tell me
09/06/2021, 19:32 - Théodore Bedos: what was it
09/06/2021, 19:32 - Théodore Bedos: I just come back from the shopping food, it is soooooooo fucking expensive
09/06/2021, 19:48 - Gracou: Im out for dinner with edie and béa xo
09/06/2021, 19:48 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/06/2021, 19:57 - Théodore Bedos: Wow
09/06/2021, 19:58 - Théodore Bedos: Who is Eddie?
09/06/2021, 20:00 - Théodore Bedos: Where are you going?
09/06/2021, 20:35 - Gracou: The food is much more expensive in France?
09/06/2021, 20:35 - Gracou: Edie is the one with a twin
09/06/2021, 20:35 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/06/2021, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: Oh I know edie, I thaught it would be written Idi
09/06/2021, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: I saw her at your bday with a purple dress, right?
09/06/2021, 21:24 - Théodore Bedos: I would have liked to see you wearing that jean
09/06/2021, 21:27 - Théodore Bedos: I would say that restaurant are not more expansive, but in supermarket yes a lot
09/06/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: I see what u mean
09/06/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: Sorry will answer soon
09/06/2021, 22:38 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight babe, I love you
09/06/2021, 22:49 - Gracou: So sorry I wasn’t able to chat with you❤️ I love you I hope u sleep well
09/06/2021, 23:57 - Gracou: I’ve only just been able to get home I waited 40 minutes at the bus stop near pultney bridge that was so awful I had to walk home in heels
09/06/2021, 23:57 - Gracou: And I’m so sad I wasn’t able to talk with you
10/06/2021, 00:00 - Gracou: I think edie wore a brown dress on my bday not a purple one :) and those jeans are the ones u have seen me in a bunch of times with the big pockets. Do u buy food for urself when ur at home? We went to a restaurant called the Underwood I think which overlooked the river :) I was so close to ur flat! And I think what I meant about the placements thing was that u will have to put up with me being on placement to last that long - when u phrased it as if I would have to be putting up with you. It wasn’t too deep i guess it’s just me being moody about the prospect of being separated from you again in the future
10/06/2021, 09:46 - Théodore Bedos: No worry, I knew you had a party and you couldn't answer
10/06/2021, 09:47 - Théodore Bedos: No I was talking about the jean with holes, not the one with the pockets
10/06/2021, 09:48 - Théodore Bedos: That sounds like an owfull and of the night, why didn't you call a uber, that ust have been scary at 2am with hills in oldfields
10/06/2021, 09:49 - Théodore Bedos: *awful end
10/06/2021, 10:59 - Gracou: Ohhhh
10/06/2021, 10:59 - Gracou: Yes but I was with béa and edie so I just went along with them
10/06/2021, 11:00 - Gracou: Did u sleep better tonight?
10/06/2021, 14:43 - Théodore Bedos: Oh that's better, I thaught that you went back alone
10/06/2021, 14:44 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't slept very well
10/06/2021, 14:45 - Théodore Bedos: I woke up again thinking that you were their
10/06/2021, 14:47 - Théodore Bedos: That's a cute picture that you just posted, I like the comment
10/06/2021, 14:55 - Gracou: I find that really touching
10/06/2021, 14:55 - Gracou: Thanks :) I didn’t know whether it would be bad to say on the internet but I thought it was funny
10/06/2021, 15:00 - Théodore Bedos: I don't remember exactly but I think that this time I was a bit pissed because you didn't wanted to sleep with just your panty
10/06/2021, 15:01 - Théodore Bedos: Because it was way too hot and I thaught you had a big jumper
10/06/2021, 15:02 - Gracou: That’s so funny
10/06/2021, 15:02 - Gracou: Im so in love with you
10/06/2021, 15:02 - Théodore Bedos: 😍
10/06/2021, 15:03 - Gracou: At lunch just now I completely zoned out of the conversation bc I was imagining u naked
10/06/2021, 15:03 - Théodore Bedos: ahaha
10/06/2021, 15:03 - Théodore Bedos: with who were you lunching?
10/06/2021, 15:04 - Gracou: Béa and Henry
10/06/2021, 15:04 - Gracou: U haven’t met Henry
10/06/2021, 15:04 - Théodore Bedos: nope
10/06/2021, 15:04 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
10/06/2021, 15:04 - Théodore Bedos: Don't know him
10/06/2021, 15:04 - Théodore Bedos: where do you know him from
10/06/2021, 15:05 - Gracou: Yeah I wouldn’t expect u to
10/06/2021, 15:05 - Gracou: We are on the same course
10/06/2021, 15:06 - Théodore Bedos: OH I think I have heard of him
10/06/2021, 15:06 - Théodore Bedos: once you were asking that guy for his grade at the coursework where you had 58%
10/06/2021, 15:06 - Gracou: Yes that’s him
10/06/2021, 15:07 - Gracou: How are applications going? Where have u applied?
10/06/2021, 15:09 - Théodore Bedos: I have done 7/8 in totals
10/06/2021, 15:09 - Théodore Bedos: In Mostly in the Uk,
10/06/2021, 15:09 - Théodore Bedos: one in swisszerland
10/06/2021, 15:09 - Gracou: U want to do a placement here?
10/06/2021, 15:10 - Théodore Bedos: I don't mind
10/06/2021, 15:10 - Gracou: Any in France?
10/06/2021, 15:10 - Théodore Bedos: I just use what the uni proposes and there are none in france now
10/06/2021, 15:10 - Gracou: Ah i see
10/06/2021, 15:12 - Gracou: Im worried darling that whilst I’m at yours France will go on the red list. If that happens then I have to either stay in France or pay £2000 to be allowed back into the UK. It that happens, will i be able to stay with u for longer?
10/06/2021, 15:12 - Théodore Bedos: Offfffff cccccoooooouurse
10/06/2021, 15:12 - Théodore Bedos: As long as you want
10/06/2021, 15:13 - Gracou: Okay i just wanted to check bc I definitely don’t want to pay £2000 🙂
10/06/2021, 15:13 - Gracou: Thank you darling
10/06/2021, 15:13 - Théodore Bedos: When they do those kind of stuff you always have one day or more to return to your country
10/06/2021, 15:14 - Gracou: Ah i see
10/06/2021, 15:14 - Gracou: Edie was telling me about it which I why I got worried
10/06/2021, 15:14 - Gracou: I don’t know much about it
10/06/2021, 15:15 - Théodore Bedos: Don't worry they are aware that some people are in hollidays or away for work and will need to come back, they are not gonna make thousands of people pay 2000 pounds for th
10/06/2021, 15:16 - Théodore Bedos: that
10/06/2021, 15:16 - Gracou: Well yes but I guess that everyone fights over the flights
10/06/2021, 15:19 - Théodore Bedos: They are aware of that, it is not like a year ago when everyone feared the covid and was closing frontieres in a rush, it's much more chill
10/06/2021, 15:19 - Théodore Bedos: but anyway you can stay all summer with me if you need to
10/06/2021, 15:19 - Gracou: Thats good :):)
10/06/2021, 15:19 - Gracou: ❤️
10/06/2021, 15:20 - Gracou: Don’t worry I wouldn’t do that it would be unfair on ur parents x
10/06/2021, 15:22 - Théodore Bedos: We would go in Normandie or in the south or in Paris, they wouldn't mind
10/06/2021, 15:23 - Gracou: Not for a whole summer darling
10/06/2021, 15:23 - Gracou: Im not as low maintenance as the stray cats😂
10/06/2021, 15:24 - Théodore Bedos: You are always welcome
10/06/2021, 15:24 - Théodore Bedos: I just received a grade for a 10% coursework
10/06/2021, 15:25 - Théodore Bedos: 10% for a 2000words report of 15 pages 😅😅
10/06/2021, 15:25 - Théodore Bedos: I had 80
10/06/2021, 15:25 - Gracou: !!!!!!!
10/06/2021, 15:25 - Gracou: Congratulations baby!!!!!!!!

10/06/2021, 15:26 - Gracou: That’s so good wow
10/06/2021, 15:26 - Théodore Bedos: But just 10%
10/06/2021, 15:26 - Gracou: Yeah but still
10/06/2021, 15:26 - Gracou: It’s a rlly good grade
10/06/2021, 15:26 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks
10/06/2021, 15:27 - Gracou: So clever
10/06/2021, 15:28 - Théodore Bedos: 😊
10/06/2021, 15:37 - Théodore Bedos: Have you done your french?
10/06/2021, 16:33 - Gracou: I will do my french now
10/06/2021, 16:43 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't aim to pressure you, I hope you didn't took it bad
10/06/2021, 16:43 - Gracou: I didn’t take it bad I do better with the pressure
10/06/2021, 16:43 - Gracou: Does que signifie make sense
10/06/2021, 16:44 - Gracou: Bc that’s what it has taught me and it is much easier than the version u taught me haha
10/06/2021, 16:44 - Gracou: I thought it might just be that u would never use it
10/06/2021, 16:47 - Théodore Bedos: If what you want to say is What does it mean? You can say 'que signifie' but it sounds very less natural than, 'Qu'est ce que ca veut dire?'
10/06/2021, 16:47 - Gracou: Okie dokie
10/06/2021, 16:47 - Gracou: It has asked me to learn both anyway
10/06/2021, 16:48 - Gracou: Did u change ur WhatsApp picture?
10/06/2021, 16:49 - Théodore Bedos: Nope
10/06/2021, 16:52 - Gracou: Ah i see
10/06/2021, 16:55 - Gracou: Do u remember how much time bday gift was when we split it 4 ways? No problemo if not
10/06/2021, 16:57 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, it cost exactly 44 pounds so 11 each
10/06/2021, 17:31 - Gracou: Thank you❤️
10/06/2021, 17:31 - Gracou: Ur memory is much better than mine
10/06/2021, 17:33 - Théodore Bedos: ahah thanks, but don't lower yourself
10/06/2021, 17:33 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
10/06/2021, 17:34 - Gracou: Babe this is what my bank app says
10/06/2021, 17:34 - Théodore Bedos: remember who who remember the you never loved me mum bet
10/06/2021, 17:34 - Gracou: So did goodbody only charge £155 for the test?
10/06/2021, 17:35 - Gracou: Or did they only charge £155 so they could keep the £49 they had charged me before and not refund it?
10/06/2021, 17:35 - Gracou: This doesn’t make sense
10/06/2021, 17:35 - Théodore Bedos: Shitty keyboard
10/06/2021, 17:35 - Théodore Bedos: remember who won the: 'you never loved me mum' bet
10/06/2021, 17:36 - Gracou: Ohhh thats true
10/06/2021, 17:36 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know why they charged you with 155 the second time
10/06/2021, 17:36 - Gracou: Yes I’m a little confused by it
10/06/2021, 17:36 - Théodore Bedos: I thaught it would be 210, and that's why I sent you 210
10/06/2021, 17:37 - Gracou: If u add up the two they charged me it is 204
10/06/2021, 17:37 - Théodore Bedos: Is it ok for you or you want me to call to try to gain back the 49 pounds?
10/06/2021, 17:38 - Gracou: Well I haven’t lost any money so I’m not bothered
10/06/2021, 17:38 - Gracou: But u might have lost money
10/06/2021, 17:38 - Gracou: If it only costs £155 then they still should refund the £49
10/06/2021, 17:38 - Gracou: And I can just send it to u
10/06/2021, 17:44 - Théodore Bedos: It should have cost 210 pounds
10/06/2021, 17:45 - Théodore Bedos: Did they pay you back the 49?
10/06/2021, 17:45 - Gracou: No they didn’t
10/06/2021, 17:45 - Gracou: And I don’t have anything pending
10/06/2021, 17:46 - Théodore Bedos: So they probably add them to make approximatly 210, but I am gonna call them so that maybe they just forgot and they might pay back the 49
10/06/2021, 17:47 - Gracou: Yeah I think so too
10/06/2021, 17:50 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
10/06/2021, 17:51 - Gracou: Ooooo
10/06/2021, 17:51 - Théodore Bedos: 1st trainning in a month, check out that pump, it's insane
10/06/2021, 17:51 - Gracou: Look at that sexy trucker tan
10/06/2021, 17:51 - Gracou: Yh u do look very pumped
10/06/2021, 17:51 - Théodore Bedos: I especially put my arm on the window during my road trip back to france for you
10/06/2021, 17:51 - Gracou: Awww❤️ how thoughtful
10/06/2021, 17:52 - Gracou: Fun fact I’m too small to comfortably lean my arm out the window like that
10/06/2021, 17:52 - Gracou: Was the drive fun even though u were so tired
10/06/2021, 17:52 - Gracou: Im surprised u even stayed awake at the wheel
10/06/2021, 17:52 - Théodore Bedos: Worst trip ever
10/06/2021, 17:53 - Théodore Bedos: Actually equality with that one time where I did 12 hour of bus with 39.5 degrees of fever
10/06/2021, 17:54 - Gracou: :(:( that sounds awful
10/06/2021, 17:54 - Gracou: Im sad u didn’t enjoy it
10/06/2021, 17:54 - Gracou: Im still curious if ur dad said anything else about me
10/06/2021, 18:04 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry but the only thing is said is that he said to my mum that she would have really liked you
10/06/2021, 18:17 - Gracou: Why are u saying sorry haha that’s really good :)
10/06/2021, 18:28 - Théodore Bedos: Because I would have liked to talk about you all the way
10/06/2021, 18:30 - Gracou: Hahaha really? :)
10/06/2021, 18:30 - Gracou: Accidental call
10/06/2021, 20:42 - Théodore Bedos: I would have liked him to talk about you all day
10/06/2021, 20:42 - Théodore Bedos: He should have
10/06/2021, 20:43 - Gracou: Oh so it’s bad that he didn’t
10/06/2021, 20:43 - Gracou: ?
10/06/2021, 20:43 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry, my godmother innvited me to the restaurant I couldn't answer
10/06/2021, 20:43 - Gracou: Don’t worry at all sweetheart
10/06/2021, 20:44 - Gracou: Was it bad he didn’t talk about me?
10/06/2021, 20:45 - Théodore Bedos: No it isn't bad, I just thought he would be more curious
10/06/2021, 20:45 - Théodore Bedos: Or that he would be more, well done my son
10/06/2021, 20:46 - Théodore Bedos: But actually I don't know how he should have react, I am his only son and I have never done it before so I have no comparaison
10/06/2021, 20:47 - Gracou: Yeah
10/06/2021, 20:47 - Gracou: Maybe bc I’ve never spoken to him about it then he didn’t want to be overbearing?
10/06/2021, 20:47 - Gracou: Or was waiting for u to bring it up?
10/06/2021, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: I brought it up once, I asked, how did you find her, and he said, very cute
10/06/2021, 20:49 - Gracou: Oh :/ I didn’t make much of an impression then
10/06/2021, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: Nooo that doesn't mean that
10/06/2021, 20:50 - Théodore Bedos: He is maybe just like that and also we had a lot to worry about during the trip soo maybe he didn't had the mind focused on you
10/06/2021, 20:51 - Théodore Bedos: Also he met you so he probably had less question to ask that if he had just heard of you
10/06/2021, 20:51 - Gracou: He said to me when you left that I shouldn’t change a single thing which I thought was a good sign of approval
10/06/2021, 20:52 - Gracou: So I’m going to hope it doesn’t have a deeper meaning that he hasn’t said much
10/06/2021, 20:52 - Théodore Bedos: Nooo there is no deeper meaning
10/06/2021, 20:52 - Théodore Bedos: I think he really like you
10/06/2021, 20:53 - Théodore Bedos: He probably just didn't wanted to tell that you were super sexy, that would have been wierd
10/06/2021, 20:53 - Théodore Bedos: to tell me
10/06/2021, 20:54 - Gracou: Yeah he said that to me in private anyway so I guess he just doesn’t feel the need to repeat it
10/06/2021, 20:54 - Gracou: How was dinner with ur Aunty?
10/06/2021, 20:54 - Théodore Bedos: untertainning
10/06/2021, 20:54 - Gracou: Oh :/
10/06/2021, 20:55 - Gracou: Did she piss u off by giving u money or something?
10/06/2021, 20:55 - Gracou: Or did u just have nothing to talk about?
10/06/2021, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: no no
10/06/2021, 20:55 - Gracou: Oh I thought u meant unentertaining
10/06/2021, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: First the waiter asked if I was her fiancé
10/06/2021, 20:55 - Gracou: Did u mean entertaining?
10/06/2021, 20:56 - Gracou: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
10/06/2021, 20:56 - Théodore Bedos: She is 53
10/06/2021, 20:56 - Gracou: U have been gone for less than a week Theodore and u have already gotten engaged to another women
10/06/2021, 20:56 - Gracou: How could u do this to me
10/06/2021, 20:56 - Gracou: And so soon
10/06/2021, 20:56 - Théodore Bedos: sorry
10/06/2021, 20:57 - Gracou: U do prefer older women I knew this would happen eventually
10/06/2021, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: sorry
10/06/2021, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: I just do what the waiter say
10/06/2021, 20:57 - Gracou: :/
10/06/2021, 20:57 - Gracou: What was ur reply when he asked
10/06/2021, 20:57 - Gracou: Was he completely serious?
10/06/2021, 20:58 - Théodore Bedos: yes he was, I said nothing because he asked her and she said that I was her godson.
10/06/2021, 20:59 - Gracou: Did he look awkward after that?
10/06/2021, 21:00 - Théodore Bedos: She looks younger than her age and she is pretty but that was still ambarassing. I think he thaught that she was one of those rich lady that has a very young boyfriend to who they pay a lot of things
10/06/2021, 21:00 - Gracou: Lol
10/06/2021, 21:00 - Gracou: Ur a toy boy
10/06/2021, 21:01 - Théodore Bedos: Ok then
10/06/2021, 21:01 - Gracou: What does ur godmother look like?
10/06/2021, 21:01 - Théodore Bedos: I don't have a picture
10/06/2021, 21:02 - Gracou: Ah okay
10/06/2021, 21:02 - Gracou: What happened after that
10/06/2021, 21:04 - Théodore Bedos: So we where in a small street, and a bin truck passed very clos to us to collect some bins. He the guy drop the bin, which bounced on the floor and then on our table.
10/06/2021, 21:05 - Théodore Bedos: The bin was empty, but the glass of red wine of my godmother dropped and she received wine on her top
10/06/2021, 21:05 - Gracou: Ooof oh dear
10/06/2021, 21:06 - Théodore Bedos: Then the waiter proposed to help removing the stain on her chest and he kept coming back to be sure that they were gone with big looks in her cleavage
10/06/2021, 21:06 - Gracou: HAHAHHAA
10/06/2021, 21:06 - Gracou: Did he try to rub her boobs?
10/06/2021, 21:07 - Théodore Bedos: wha do you mean by rub
10/06/2021, 21:07 - Gracou: And did u two laugh about it? Did she know she had been stated at
10/06/2021, 21:07 - Gracou: Rub is similar to stroke
10/06/2021, 21:07 - Théodore Bedos: I think he tried
10/06/2021, 21:07 - Gracou: And was it the same waiter? He must have really fancied her
10/06/2021, 21:08 - Théodore Bedos: I think the same yes
10/06/2021, 21:08 - Théodore Bedos: Then I had a bubble tea with my cousin that was there too
10/06/2021, 21:09 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
10/06/2021, 21:09 - Gracou: Oh so they assumed ur cousin was ur future step child or something?
10/06/2021, 21:09 - Gracou: The sky looks very pretty
10/06/2021, 21:09 - Théodore Bedos: She wasn't their yet when we arrived
10/06/2021, 21:10 - Gracou: So does she, she has a very natural face
10/06/2021, 21:10 - Gracou: How old is she?
10/06/2021, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: She is 19
10/06/2021, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: February 2002
10/06/2021, 21:12 - Gracou: Oh cute :)
10/06/2021, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: She looks quiet young in general
10/06/2021, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe not the best picture also
10/06/2021, 21:12 - Gracou: But she has boobs which makes her look older
10/06/2021, 21:13 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
10/06/2021, 21:13 - Gracou: Are u marketing ur cousin to me?
10/06/2021, 21:13 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah
10/06/2021, 21:13 - Théodore Bedos: I want you to know to know that their are quality genes in that family
10/06/2021, 21:14 - Théodore Bedos: (Actually my father has been adopted so their is no blood connection....)
10/06/2021, 21:14 - Gracou: Thinking ahead?
10/06/2021, 21:15 - Théodore Bedos: nothing it was just to make the joke
10/06/2021, 21:15 - Gracou: All of ur blood relatives could be rlly ugly but considering the fact that all of ur dads children are good looking (even without ur mums genes) I think ur fine
10/06/2021, 21:15 - Gracou: I was also making a joke
10/06/2021, 21:16 - Théodore Bedos: What do you think about my dad?
10/06/2021, 21:17 - Gracou: Dilf 100%
10/06/2021, 21:17 - Théodore Bedos: What's a dilf??
10/06/2021, 21:17 - Théodore Bedos: A masculine milf?
10/06/2021, 21:17 - Gracou: Yes
10/06/2021, 21:17 - Théodore Bedos: Never heard that ever
10/06/2021, 21:17 - Gracou: There is also gilf
10/06/2021, 21:17 - Gracou: Grandfather
10/06/2021, 21:17 - Théodore Bedos: 😂😂
10/06/2021, 21:17 - Gracou: It’s actually a type of porn that one I think
10/06/2021, 21:18 - Gracou: I liked ur dad bc he didn’t put too much pressure on me and gave me compliments
10/06/2021, 21:18 - Gracou: And I thought he was well dressed
10/06/2021, 21:18 - Gracou: But I kept panicking while talking that he couldn’t understand me so I asked him more questions I guess
10/06/2021, 21:18 - Gracou: He probably thinks I’m rlly panicky
10/06/2021, 21:19 - Gracou: Did I tell u I shouted in his ear?
10/06/2021, 21:19 - Gracou: That was embarrassing
10/06/2021, 21:19 - Théodore Bedos: Noo that was more than normal
10/06/2021, 21:20 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't think it was embarrassing
10/06/2021, 21:20 - Gracou: When I shouted in his ear?
10/06/2021, 21:20 - Théodore Bedos: When was that?
10/06/2021, 21:21 - Théodore Bedos: He just said that he was very surprised when you jumped at him to shake his hand
10/06/2021, 21:21 - Théodore Bedos: He thought you would stay on your seat
10/06/2021, 21:21 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
10/06/2021, 21:21 - Gracou: It’s polite in England to stand to greet someone
10/06/2021, 21:22 - Gracou: It would be considered rude if I stayed sat down
10/06/2021, 21:22 - Gracou: It would imply Im more important than him
10/06/2021, 21:22 - Gracou: Idk if u have that in France
10/06/2021, 21:25 - Théodore Bedos: Ahaha that's funny I didn't know that happened. Of course that is normal to stand up when someone arrive, but you did it very quickly in front of him and he was surprised
10/06/2021, 21:26 - Gracou: Oh whoops I didn’t mean to
10/06/2021, 21:26 - Gracou: I did think he looked surprised at the time
10/06/2021, 21:26 - Gracou: I probably thought things were happening quicker than they were which is why I jumped up
10/06/2021, 21:29 - Théodore Bedos: It's ok, I thought it was a very noce day anyway
10/06/2021, 21:30 - Théodore Bedos: I am impatient to see you hre and that you meet my mum
10/06/2021, 22:32 - Gracou: Oh sorry I didn’t realise u sent these

11/06/2021, 21:20 - Gracou: Admittedly I used my arms to balance me to begin with
11/06/2021, 21:22 - Théodore Bedos: What do you mean
11/06/2021, 21:22 - Théodore Bedos: you grabbed my shoulders?
11/06/2021, 21:22 - Gracou: Yes

11/06/2021, 21:30 - Théodore Bedos: We have plenty of grass
11/06/2021, 21:30 - Théodore Bedos: But I would catch even on lava
11/06/2021, 21:32 - Gracou: I don’t think so I think I could definitely fall
11/06/2021, 21:52 - Théodore Bedos: NEVER
11/06/2021, 21:52 - Théodore Bedos: I would catch you
11/06/2021, 21:53 - Gracou: Sexy Theodore I feel like I could just be yeeted right over your head if I picked up too much force
11/06/2021, 21:55 - Théodore Bedos: I'll never let you fall sexy Grace

11/06/2021, 22:14 - Gracou: Oh, why?
11/06/2021, 22:24 - Théodore Bedos: Because she will be too stressed every time would move something
11/06/2021, 22:25 - Gracou: Oh haha
11/06/2021, 22:25 - Gracou: You’re not moving it very far though right?
11/06/2021, 22:25 - Gracou: I thought you were going to sleep babe x
11/06/2021, 22:26 - Théodore Bedos: She's like that she can sometimes just fix on something that is really not a big deal and make it à big deal
11/06/2021, 22:26 - Gracou: Hmm

12/06/2021, 15:34 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
12/06/2021, 15:35 - Théodore Bedos: Arrived
12/06/2021, 16:13 - Gracou: Ooo fun I hope it’s going well
12/06/2021, 16:13 - Gracou: I had a migraine earlier so have done next to nothing today :/
12/06/2021, 18:29 - Théodore Bedos: What caused you that migraine?
12/06/2021, 18:30 - Théodore Bedos: Are you better now?
12/06/2021, 18:57 - Gracou: I choked on my own saliva 😂😂
12/06/2021, 18:57 - Gracou: Yes I’m fine x
12/06/2021, 18:58 - Gracou: Did u move everything?
12/06/2021, 21:02 - Théodore Bedos: What does it mean you choked your own saliva?
12/06/2021, 21:02 - Théodore Bedos: Yes we nearly moved everything
12/06/2021, 21:03 - Gracou: Which part do u not understand?
12/06/2021, 21:03 - Gracou: Are u still lifting?
12/06/2021, 21:03 - Théodore Bedos: I just need to move the fridge and washing mashin before leaving
12/06/2021, 21:03 - Gracou: By yourself?!
12/06/2021, 21:04 - Théodore Bedos: I don't understand how choking your saliva can cause a migrain
12/06/2021, 21:04 - Théodore Bedos: No I have my uncle that will help me
12/06/2021, 21:06 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I have my very good friend from Japan who sent me a snap today where he was a bit drunk and he told me that he really love me
12/06/2021, 21:09 - Théodore Bedos: 9I don't know if that is first degree or a friendly love, because I always thought he was slightly slightly weird but I thaught he was jusst like that
12/06/2021, 21:29 - Gracou: Sorry I’m at a bbq so my replies will be a little short
12/06/2021, 21:29 - Gracou: Basically any intense feeling can give me a migraine
12/06/2021, 21:29 - Gracou: Phew
12/06/2021, 21:29 - Gracou: Compétition
12/06/2021, 21:29 - Gracou: Just ask him in which way
12/06/2021, 21:40 - Théodore Bedos: That's not easy to ask, if it is friendly he might take it badly that I think he is gay
12/06/2021, 21:41 - Gracou: Hahahaha
12/06/2021, 21:41 - Gracou: He’s drunk tho so it couldn’t be that bad
12/06/2021, 21:41 - Gracou: Maybe ask him what made him think of u?
12/06/2021, 22:30 - Théodore Bedos: I told him that I couldn't hear what he said because I was with my family and so I turned down the volume. I'll see if he confirms or not
12/06/2021, 22:32 - Gracou: Did u ask him to repeat it?
12/06/2021, 22:34 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
12/06/2021, 22:34 - Théodore Bedos: Is it a bad idea?
12/06/2021, 22:54 - Gracou: No I think that’s a good solution
13/06/2021, 12:49 - Gracou: I love you❤️
13/06/2021, 13:34 - Théodore Bedos: I love you
13/06/2021, 13:37 - Théodore Bedos: HOw was your bbq yesterday?
13/06/2021, 14:28 - Gracou: It was really really fun honestly I had a super nice time
13/06/2021, 14:28 - Gracou: Im at the weir today it so so sunny and hot
13/06/2021, 14:28 - Gracou: What about u?
13/06/2021, 14:47 - Théodore Bedos: That sounds nice, I wish I was near a pool or the see now, it is burning hot
13/06/2021, 14:48 - Théodore Bedos: I'm not up to much today, we have done nearly everything yesterday. I told them that 3 day was too much for doing this
13/06/2021, 14:49 - Théodore Bedos: My friend answered me, "No worry at all, I was just tipsy"
13/06/2021, 14:50 - Théodore Bedos: If it was just a friendly bro I love you, he would have say it again
13/06/2021, 14:50 - Théodore Bedos: Is the weir crowded or are all the student gone now?
13/06/2021, 16:56 - Gracou: I thought ur auntie had that little pool?
13/06/2021, 16:56 - Gracou: I agree it probs wasn’t that friendly - plus he threw in a bro to seem more hetero
13/06/2021, 16:57 - Gracou: It’s so so crowded but there are tonnes of families and less students

15/06/2021, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: I thaught that you wet to another mini golf
15/06/2021, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: went
15/06/2021, 20:51 - Théodore Bedos: I played basketball down my house this afternoon, it was 32 degree under the shadow, when I stopped I thaught that I was about to faint in my stairs
15/06/2021, 20:53 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
15/06/2021, 20:53 - Théodore Bedos: I kept sweating 1 hour after, it was crazy
15/06/2021, 20:54 - Théodore Bedos: I felt soo much unfit
15/06/2021, 21:43 - Gracou: Yes we did go to another mini golf and then we went to that bar afterwards and now we are just walking back after sitting in the park
15/06/2021, 21:44 - Gracou: Babe that’s the temperature not bc ur unfit
15/06/2021, 21:44 - Gracou: U look sexy
15/06/2021, 22:09 - Théodore Bedos: I hope so, but between the 4 people I play with I was the most roasted at the end
15/06/2021, 22:09 - Gracou: Then u are becoming like me
15/06/2021, 22:09 - Théodore Bedos: Honestly I have rarely been that tired
15/06/2021, 22:09 - Gracou: So unpleasant to play in 32 degrees tho
15/06/2021, 22:10 - Gracou: Who did u play with I thought you didn’t have friends
15/06/2021, 22:10 - Théodore Bedos: On a basketball playground you will always find some people to play against
15/06/2021, 22:11 - Théodore Bedos: I went alone and I played with one guy, and then 2 others
15/06/2021, 22:11 - Théodore Bedos: I had to make a pose in my stairs because I was about to faint
15/06/2021, 22:12 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe I will end up in the same state if we have sex under 32 degrees
15/06/2021, 22:13 - Gracou: Babe that’s a great way to make friends
15/06/2021, 22:13 - Gracou: I know u said before thats quite unpleasant
15/06/2021, 22:13 - Gracou: Im willing to try it to find up
15/06/2021, 22:13 - Gracou: I won’t be on top tho
15/06/2021, 22:14 - Gracou: Out*
15/06/2021, 22:15 - Théodore Bedos: We just watched the first game of france at the euro agins germany in familly
15/06/2021, 22:15 - Théodore Bedos: we all had KFC tenders and fries
15/06/2021, 22:15 - Théodore Bedos: you would have liked it
15/06/2021, 22:22 - Gracou: Ahh that’s nice
15/06/2021, 22:22 - Gracou: Who is we
15/06/2021, 22:37 - Théodore Bedos: My parents, my godmother and her daughter my cousin
15/06/2021, 22:37 - Théodore Bedos: And the 3 cats
15/06/2021, 22:37 - Théodore Bedos: And we won
15/06/2021, 22:38 - Gracou: What’s the score and who scored joe wants to know
15/06/2021, 22:38 - Gracou: Woooooo congratulations baby!!!
15/06/2021, 22:38 - Gracou: Sounds like a nice group
15/06/2021, 22:38 - Gracou: Jo didn’t join?
15/06/2021, 22:39 - Théodore Bedos: 1-0 for France, own goal of Hummels
15/06/2021, 22:40 - Théodore Bedos: But the ref really has been shit and that could have easily been a 3-0 for us
15/06/2021, 22:40 - Gracou: Oooooooo
15/06/2021, 22:40 - Gracou: Hahaha
15/06/2021, 22:40 - Théodore Bedos: one guy knee striked a french player and knocked him out, and he didn't give a card
15/06/2021, 22:40 - Gracou: Ur such a bitter winner
15/06/2021, 22:41 - Gracou: Lol
15/06/2021, 22:41 - Théodore Bedos: And he didn't whistle one of the most obvious penalty ever
15/06/2021, 22:41 - Gracou: Did he faint?
15/06/2021, 22:41 - Gracou: No one wanted France to win apparently
15/06/2021, 22:41 - Théodore Bedos: He was on the ground not moving for a few minuts
15/06/2021, 22:41 - Théodore Bedos: At the end he gave 7 minutes of extra time
15/06/2021, 22:41 - Théodore Bedos: He really played against us
15/06/2021, 22:43 - Théodore Bedos: He really got on my nerves
15/06/2021, 22:43 - Gracou: No way lol
15/06/2021, 22:52 - Théodore Bedos: Do you have some propositions of game that you wanna play?
15/06/2021, 23:11 - Gracou: No I don’t think I know that many
15/06/2021, 23:12 - Gracou: Don’t worry if ur busy
15/06/2021, 23:12 - Gracou: We don’t need to call
15/06/2021, 23:36 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
15/06/2021, 23:37 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
15/06/2021, 23:37 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
15/06/2021, 23:37 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
15/06/2021, 23:37 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
15/06/2021, 23:38 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
16/06/2021, 00:30 - Gracou: Sleep well ❤️ I miss you
16/06/2021, 00:30 - Gracou: It was really nice to be able to talk like normal thanks for staying up
16/06/2021, 00:30 - Théodore Bedos: I love you, I'll do it again
16/06/2021, 00:31 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks for calling me
16/06/2021, 00:31 - Gracou: :):):)
16/06/2021, 11:53 - Théodore Bedos: I checked the tickets around the dates you told me and it is complicate to come by plane. There is no direct plane from bristol until end of july, you would have to do Bristol-Amsterdam Amsterdam-Paris for around 160-190 euros.
16/06/2021, 11:54 - Théodore Bedos: The best I think is to take the eurostar in London, that would cost around 110/130 euros
16/06/2021, 11:54 - Théodore Bedos: And you would arrive directly in Paris so easier for me to go get you
16/06/2021, 11:55 - Gracou: Weirdly I was going to suggest doing the euro star to you even tho it will be a long journey
16/06/2021, 11:55 - Gracou: Bc I have been getting very anxious about going on a plane since I haven’t been in so long and would have to be alone
16/06/2021, 11:56 - Gracou: And last night I woke up in the middle of the night bc I died trapped in a plane in my dream and got rlly freaked out haha
16/06/2021, 11:56 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't know you would worry about that
16/06/2021, 11:56 - Théodore Bedos: I get it no worry
16/06/2021, 11:56 - Gracou: Weirdly I don’t mind it when my family is there
16/06/2021, 11:56 - Théodore Bedos: I find it scary to not to be in control of your death, and that's the case in a plane
16/06/2021, 11:56 - Gracou: Bc at least I would die with them
16/06/2021, 11:56 - Gracou: Which is probably bad logic
16/06/2021, 11:57 - Gracou: Yeah same
16/06/2021, 11:57 - Gracou: And I’m scared of dying alone
16/06/2021, 11:57 - Théodore Bedos: Ahaha, yeah you would prefere that they die instead of just you dying
16/06/2021, 11:57 - Gracou: And I’m a bit superstitious about certain things
16/06/2021, 11:58 - Gracou: My dad used to have seats at the Manchester arena so we would go to concerts there and every time I was there I had this weird feeling there would be a terrorist attach for no reason
16/06/2021, 11:58 - Gracou: And then later on it was obviously bombed
16/06/2021, 11:58 - Théodore Bedos: Alright so just take the eurostar, it is nearly the same length as you don't have to arrive hours earlier as you would do for a plane. And you arrive directly in paris which save you the cost of a cab
16/06/2021, 11:58 - Gracou: Yeah totally
16/06/2021, 11:58 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah you told me about the concert thing
16/06/2021, 11:59 - Gracou: Yeah
16/06/2021, 11:59 - Gracou: It’s very silly but my aunt Nan and sister all they are psychic lol so I’m a bit superstitious about times
16/06/2021, 11:59 - Gracou: And by superstitious I mean a pussy
16/06/2021, 12:00 - Gracou: All think they are*
16/06/2021, 12:00 - Théodore Bedos: aha
16/06/2021, 12:00 - Théodore Bedos: So tell me how long would you like to stay in Paris?
16/06/2021, 12:01 - Gracou: Well that depends on what stuff u want to do
16/06/2021, 12:02 - Théodore Bedos: You are the one visiting not me, I don't know of how much visiting you want to do, but actually it doesn't matter much because we can move to Normandie whenever
16/06/2021, 12:02 - Théodore Bedos: When would you like to arrive?
16/06/2021, 12:02 - Théodore Bedos: 2,3,4 of july?
16/06/2021, 12:03 - Gracou: My parents wanted me to talk about it with them
16/06/2021, 12:03 - Théodore Bedos: Oh ok
16/06/2021, 12:04 - Gracou: But I’m guessing it’s not going to be before the 3rd bc I will probs stay the night on the 1st in bath
16/06/2021, 12:04 - Gracou: Bc I need to clean the house as well as move everything
16/06/2021, 12:04 - Gracou: Is that okay?
16/06/2021, 12:06 - Théodore Bedos: Why don't you go directly from Bath?
16/06/2021, 12:06 - Gracou: Because I need to take my mums car back if I borrow it
16/06/2021, 12:07 - Théodore Bedos: Oh I thaught you would come with your father to Bath
16/06/2021, 12:08 - Gracou: I would if I only needed to move things but bc I will have to clean I might go by myself so I don’t waste their time
16/06/2021, 12:09 - Théodore Bedos: I see, I see
16/06/2021, 12:10 - Gracou: But I think that’s partially what they want to talk about to work everything about
16/06/2021, 12:12 - Théodore Bedos: But don't come to late because I am actually not sure that you can come to my granny house in the south. Because my granny, my mother, her brother and his wife and children will be there and so there won't be enough room for both of us.
16/06/2021, 12:13 - Théodore Bedos: And so that would be the limit of how long you can stay
16/06/2021, 12:13 - Théodore Bedos: Who will be there is still in discussion, but that's an eventuality
16/06/2021, 12:14 - Théodore Bedos: And I would be annoyed if I see you only 10 days
16/06/2021, 12:15 - Gracou: Could you remind me which day you have to go to your granny’s?
16/06/2021, 12:15 - Théodore Bedos: At the moment we are thinking about the 18th
16/06/2021, 12:15 - Théodore Bedos: It's very complicate
16/06/2021, 12:16 - Gracou: Okay well I will try to plan around that then
16/06/2021, 18:43 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
16/06/2021, 19:53 - Théodore Bedos: Identical
16/06/2021, 19:53 - Théodore Bedos: Also (this one doesn't work)
16/06/2021, 20:14 - Gracou: Why doesn’t it work
16/06/2021, 20:14 - Gracou: Also they don’t check whether it works when ur in shops
16/06/2021, 21:11 - Théodore Bedos: It doesn't work on the machines, I have another one that work, you can keep it
16/06/2021, 21:14 - Gracou: Oh why did u have it then
16/06/2021, 21:15 - Théodore Bedos: At diner today we were talking about the day of music last year, and remembering where everyone went. And I said at some point that I remember how hard it had been to go to bed at 6 and wake up at 9 to work for Bosch. My mum, said 'oh I don't remember that, where have you been' and I remembered that I came back late because I slept with my Selma my sister friend, so I said 'I was with Eliot until late, then I don't remember really'. And my sister said, 'Oh me I remember where you were...'
16/06/2021, 21:15 - Théodore Bedos: Which means that she knows about that
16/06/2021, 21:15 - Théodore Bedos: that was so akward
16/06/2021, 21:16 - Gracou: Hahahahahhaha
16/06/2021, 21:16 - Théodore Bedos: I thaught she didn't know
16/06/2021, 21:16 - Gracou: I can’t believe she knows about that
16/06/2021, 21:16 - Gracou: That’s hilarious babe
16/06/2021, 21:16 - Gracou: Selma must have said something
16/06/2021, 21:16 - Gracou: I want the gossip can u interrogate jo
16/06/2021, 21:17 - Théodore Bedos: No I am definatly gonna avoid this subject for ever
16/06/2021, 21:17 - Gracou: Jo might have told ur sister ur bad in bed hahahahaha
16/06/2021, 21:17 - Gracou: Selma*
16/06/2021, 21:18 - Théodore Bedos: I don't think that it is Selma who said it, I think she has friend in commons with my sister who told her
16/06/2021, 21:18 - Gracou: Yh i think so too
16/06/2021, 21:18 - Gracou: But still
16/06/2021, 21:19 - Gracou: I can’t believe ur not curious
16/06/2021, 21:19 - Gracou: I can’t believe she never mentioned it
16/06/2021, 21:19 - Théodore Bedos: I am very curious but I just really don't want to have that kind of conversetion with her
16/06/2021, 21:20 - Gracou: Sigh
16/06/2021, 21:20 - Gracou: She knows u have sex babe there is no need to be weird about it
16/06/2021, 21:20 - Théodore Bedos: Yes but not necessarly with her ex best friend
16/06/2021, 21:21 - Théodore Bedos: / ennemy now
16/06/2021, 21:23 - Gracou: Welll she clearly does know that
16/06/2021, 21:25 - Théodore Bedos: You'll ask her when you'll come
16/06/2021, 21:25 - Gracou: I was mentally planning how I could talk to her about it actually
16/06/2021, 21:26 - Gracou: Gunna have to find the french for ‘best friend fucking brother’
16/06/2021, 21:26 - Théodore Bedos: Have you done your french today?
16/06/2021, 21:27 - Gracou: Yes babe!
16/06/2021, 21:28 - Théodore Bedos: Well done
16/06/2021, 22:05 - Gracou: Babe how secluded is ur Normandie garden
16/06/2021, 22:15 - Théodore Bedos: There is wall around the full proprety but we share the full proprety between 3 cousin family
16/06/2021, 22:16 - Théodore Bedos: But we are rarely all their at the same time
16/06/2021, 22:16 - Gracou: Hmm
16/06/2021, 22:16 - Théodore Bedos: why?
16/06/2021, 22:16 - Gracou: And in July would it be expected that people would be there
16/06/2021, 22:16 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
16/06/2021, 22:17 - Gracou: Imagining making love to u under the stars
16/06/2021, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: This is not a problem
16/06/2021, 22:17 - Gracou: Would people be there
16/06/2021, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: The garden is very very big
16/06/2021, 22:17 - Gracou: Still would people be there
16/06/2021, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know
16/06/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: Okie dokie
16/06/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: Looking forward to it either way
16/06/2021, 22:19 - Gracou: Will just be more of a pussy if ur cousins are sat on the patio
16/06/2021, 22:19 - Théodore Bedos: I see but di-on't worry it is big
16/06/2021, 22:19 - Théodore Bedos: like 30 times your garden in total
16/06/2021, 22:20 - Gracou: I miss how big it is ;)
16/06/2021, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: aha
16/06/2021, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: And the vegetable garden is completely isolated
16/06/2021, 22:20 - Gracou: Well that’s fabulous
16/06/2021, 22:21 - Gracou: Maybe u should watch cucumber porn to prepare
16/06/2021, 22:23 - Théodore Bedos: I'm glad we don't do cucumber
16/06/2021, 22:23 - Gracou: Do u not like cucumber
16/06/2021, 22:24 - Théodore Bedos: not for sex
16/06/2021, 22:25 - Gracou: Well why would we do cucumber for sex
16/06/2021, 22:29 - Théodore Bedos: You just talked about cucumber porn
16/06/2021, 22:29 - Gracou: Im still confused by what u me at
16/06/2021, 22:29 - Gracou: Meant
16/06/2021, 22:30 - Théodore Bedos: You just said that I should watch cucumber porn to prepare
16/06/2021, 22:31 - Théodore Bedos: I'm telling you that I am glad we don't grow cucumber because I don't want to have sex with cucumbers
16/06/2021, 22:32 - Gracou: I hope u don’t get that desperate while I’m gone
16/06/2021, 22:36 - Théodore Bedos: I'm fine

16/06/2021, 23:17 - Théodore Bedos: No it was good, just understand when I make a reference to your own joke
16/06/2021, 23:17 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to bed, sleep well my love

16/06/2021, 23:19 - Gracou: I love you sweet dreams❤️
17/06/2021, 02:06 - Gracou: Ce message a été supprimé.
17/06/2021, 08:39 - Théodore Bedos: What was it?
17/06/2021, 09:30 - Gracou: Me being horny
17/06/2021, 09:34 - Théodore Bedos: Why are you deleting it then??
17/06/2021, 09:34 - Théodore Bedos: Babe
17/06/2021, 09:34 - Gracou: What babe
17/06/2021, 09:34 - Gracou: You were asleep
17/06/2021, 09:35 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah but that's the best thing ever to see at wake up
17/06/2021, 09:35 - Gracou: I was talking about how I had spent most of the night wanting to give you head
17/06/2021, 09:36 - Gracou: And had reached the point where I wanted u to give me head which was just sad
17/06/2021, 09:36 - Gracou: Not the sexiest message
17/06/2021, 09:40 - Gracou: See this is part of the reason I deleted it - bc I felt like u would just leave me on read
17/06/2021, 09:47 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I would never let you on read
17/06/2021, 09:48 - Théodore Bedos: I really like to hear that you think about me in any way
17/06/2021, 09:56 - Gracou: You do leave me on read a lot actually
17/06/2021, 10:18 - Théodore Bedos: Only because my keyboard is broken
17/06/2021, 10:20 - Théodore Bedos: If I have the time to answer with this I would always do
17/06/2021, 10:22 - Gracou: :/
17/06/2021, 10:23 - Théodore Bedos: What does that mean
17/06/2021, 10:24 - Gracou: Im just being a bit grumpy I suppose
17/06/2021, 10:25 - Gracou: Logically I know it’s not the case just emotionally I feel a little unwanted I just woke up that way
17/06/2021, 10:27 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I want you so badly
17/06/2021, 10:29 - Théodore Bedos: I just begged you to tell me what was the message, because I want every single message from you
17/06/2021, 10:30 - Théodore Bedos: And I keep asking you every day when you'll be here, so much I need you
17/06/2021, 10:30 - Gracou: Sometimes I feel like you just want to hear it bc it makes you feel good and important and you don’t reciprocate
17/06/2021, 10:31 - Gracou: Thank you I need to hear that kind of thing
17/06/2021, 10:31 - Gracou: Thanks for being reassuring instead of defensive I appreciate it
17/06/2021, 10:34 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I love you so much. You are the most important to me
17/06/2021, 10:35 - Gracou: I love you too❤️ you’re the most important to me too
17/06/2021, 10:51 - Théodore Bedos: What are you up to today, do you want to play some games?
17/06/2021, 10:51 - Gracou: Im currently procrastinating in bed but I actually have a lot to do
17/06/2021, 10:51 - Gracou: I need to finish packing and I have to return some things in town
17/06/2021, 10:52 - Gracou: So i probably can’t play today :(

17/06/2021, 13:21 - Gracou: Why are u surprised
17/06/2021, 13:22 - Gracou: Your beard is looking quite long
17/06/2021, 13:27 - Théodore Bedos: Because I just don't see it much
17/06/2021, 13:28 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it's a bit long. You're not around so I'm trying to let it grow
17/06/2021, 13:31 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
17/06/2021, 13:31 - Gracou: Indentical
17/06/2021, 13:31 - Gracou: I thought that might be the case

17/06/2021, 15:34 - Théodore Bedos: When are you leaving the house today?
17/06/2021, 15:35 - Gracou: My mum is arriving here at around 5 so after that
17/06/2021, 15:35 - Gracou: I’ve already checked so that there should be someone at the house to collect the flowers
17/06/2021, 15:36 - Théodore Bedos: Is it not 5 already in england?
17/06/2021, 15:36 - Gracou: It’s 3:36

17/06/2021, 15:37 - Théodore Bedos: You know they should have arrived this morning

17/06/2021, 15:57 - Théodore Bedos: Ahaha
17/06/2021, 15:57 - Gracou: :)
17/06/2021, 15:58 - Théodore Bedos: We should have not talked about it, I hope you would forget it and be a bit surprised
17/06/2021, 15:58 - Gracou: You’re too impatient to not tell
Me
17/06/2021, 15:58 - Gracou: Im much more patent with this stuff
17/06/2021, 15:59 - Théodore Bedos: You are
17/06/2021, 16:00 - Théodore Bedos: But it was a bit special, I wanted you to not miss them as you were their just a short time before leaving
17/06/2021, 16:00 - Gracou: Im going to have to start dropping hints soon so u find something before I come to France
17/06/2021, 16:00 - Gracou: Yes but I’m going to bring them with me xo
17/06/2021, 16:01 - Théodore Bedos: Are you joking, you hide something?
17/06/2021, 16:01 - Gracou: I did
17/06/2021, 16:01 - Théodore Bedos: Noooo way
17/06/2021, 16:01 - Théodore Bedos: Come on tell me
17/06/2021, 16:01 - Gracou: No u have to find it
17/06/2021, 16:01 - Gracou: It’s not that exciting
17/06/2021, 16:02 - Théodore Bedos: But what if I miss it and it goes into a luggage and my sister brings it away
17/06/2021, 16:02 - Théodore Bedos: or I throw it in the bin by mistake
17/06/2021, 16:03 - Gracou: I Theodore-proofed it
17/06/2021, 16:03 - Gracou: It’s somewhere where that wouldn’t happen
17/06/2021, 16:04 - Théodore Bedos: What is Theodore-proofed it
17/06/2021, 16:04 - Gracou: If you proof something ur protecting it sort of
17/06/2021, 16:04 - Gracou: So bacically I’ve made it so u can accidentally discard it
17/06/2021, 16:04 - Gracou: I thought u would find it much sooner
17/06/2021, 16:05 - Gracou: Cant*
17/06/2021, 16:08 - Théodore Bedos: I just found it
17/06/2021, 16:09 - Gracou: That was quick
17/06/2021, 16:10 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I love you soo much
17/06/2021, 16:10 - Théodore Bedos: I am entirely yours to
17/06/2021, 16:11 - Gracou: I wrote it on my birthday bc I knew I wouldn’t have a chance to after u finished exams
17/06/2021, 16:11 - Gracou: I hid it the night that I did the roses, it’s part of the reason I took so long
17/06/2021, 16:12 - Gracou: Im glad you like it
17/06/2021, 16:12 - Théodore Bedos: It means a lot to me
17/06/2021, 16:12 - Gracou: I was worried u wouldn’t like it so I tried not to be too cliche and gushy
17/06/2021, 16:12 - Gracou: :)
17/06/2021, 16:13 - Gracou: It was also on my mind that time u told me I didn’t make u feel special at my house haha I almost blew it by being like ‘u have no clue’
17/06/2021, 16:13 - Théodore Bedos: I love you
17/06/2021, 16:14 - Gracou: I love you too
17/06/2021, 16:14 - Théodore Bedos: I was a bit like you this morning at and after Tom's party I felt quiet unwanted until we had this conversation
17/06/2021, 16:15 - Gracou: Which conversation?
17/06/2021, 16:15 - Gracou: Yes I understand at Tom’s party I started not giving u as much affection
17/06/2021, 16:16 - Théodore Bedos: When I told you what was bothering me outside on your terrasse after the nuggets lunch that you made
17/06/2021, 16:16 - Gracou: Yes yes I know xo
17/06/2021, 16:16 - Théodore Bedos: I guess I have some sort of men periods too
17/06/2021, 16:16 - Gracou: Hahaha I think it’s normal for everyone when ur in love
17/06/2021, 16:17 - Théodore Bedos: Babe, to be honest, this message just pushed my love for you so high wwhen I read it that I have a bonner right now
17/06/2021, 16:19 - Gracou: Hahahhhahahaha
17/06/2021, 16:19 - Gracou: No way
17/06/2021, 16:21 - Gracou: I love that u appreciate mushy stuff
17/06/2021, 16:22 - Théodore Bedos: I looked in all my books because I thaught it could be in between to pages
17/06/2021, 16:23 - Gracou: Hahaha
17/06/2021, 16:23 - Gracou: No I wouldn’t have hid it there bc it’s so unlikely u would find it
17/06/2021, 16:23 - Gracou: I thought u would use ur headphones while travelling and find it
17/06/2021, 16:26 - Théodore Bedos: Normally yes, but with 35 degrees outside, I was planning to use my big earphones for a while
17/06/2021, 16:28 - Gracou: That makes sense
17/06/2021, 16:28 - Gracou: Anyway I hope you feel super loved because you are
17/06/2021, 16:34 - Théodore Bedos: I am
17/06/2021, 16:34 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to join my friend now

17/06/2021, 20:35 - Gracou: My mum is such an attention hog haha
17/06/2021, 20:35 - Gracou: I was doing my french practicing in the car
17/06/2021, 20:36 - Gracou: And my mum just started doing the answers before I could answer them hahaha
17/06/2021, 20:36 - Gracou: I just turned to her and went ‘which one of us needs to be tested on their french here Rachel’
17/06/2021, 20:37 - Gracou: She’s going to start telling me about her award winning swimming career in a minute
17/06/2021, 21:03 - Théodore Bedos: Ahah that's very funny
17/06/2021, 21:03 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
17/06/2021, 21:04 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
17/06/2021, 21:04 - Gracou: Guess the music theme

17/06/2021, 21:05 - Gracou: I’m glad you’re having a good time baby that makes me happy :)
17/06/2021, 21:06 - Théodore Bedos: Are you close to arrive
17/06/2021, 21:06 - Théodore Bedos: ?

17/06/2021, 21:09 - Gracou: Why do you ask :)
17/06/2021, 21:09 - Gracou: Can u not wait for me to receive my flowers
17/06/2021, 21:09 - Théodore Bedos: No I just want to know what is happening to you
17/06/2021, 21:10 - Gracou: Ahh
17/06/2021, 21:10 - Gracou: Yes I’m still smushed beneath my plants
17/06/2021, 21:10 - Gracou: I will send u a picture
17/06/2021, 21:12 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
17/06/2021, 21:13 - Gracou: Can u send me one of where you are
17/06/2021, 21:20 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
17/06/2021, 21:21 - Théodore Bedos: In the living room
17/06/2021, 21:21 - Gracou: Awww I assumed u were out
17/06/2021, 21:21 - Gracou: Ooo there is a guest appearance from Raf
17/06/2021, 21:22 - Théodore Bedos: No I came back when I started to message you
17/06/2021, 21:22 - Gracou: Ur apartment doesn’t look as old fashioned as u made out
17/06/2021, 21:22 - Gracou: Ahhh I see
17/06/2021, 21:25 - Théodore Bedos: They just repainted the wood beams in white but it used to be brown and it looked even oolder
17/06/2021, 21:26 - Théodore Bedos: The rest is all antics fournitures
17/06/2021, 21:27 - Gracou: Ahhh I see
17/06/2021, 21:27 - Gracou: I like it in white
17/06/2021, 21:27 - Gracou: Is ur sofa antique
17/06/2021, 21:27 - Théodore Bedos: Nope
17/06/2021, 21:27 - Gracou: Well not all then
17/06/2021, 21:28 - Théodore Bedos: They didn't had very confortable sofas at the time
17/06/2021, 21:28 - Gracou: Certainly not
17/06/2021, 21:28 - Gracou: But getting splinters from ur furniture isn’t very comfortable either and ur parents are fine w it
17/06/2021, 21:28 - Théodore Bedos: And I'm not sure having an antic furniture on which a 90kg dude jump on 6 times a day is a good idea
17/06/2021, 21:29 - Gracou: Sorry what is 90kg in Grace? I’m not familiar with that measurement
17/06/2021, 21:30 - Théodore Bedos: 1,73 Graces
17/06/2021, 21:31 - Gracou: Ah thanks that makes a lot more sense
17/06/2021, 21:31 - Gracou: Yeah an antique sofa couldn’t take that
17/06/2021, 21:31 - Gracou: Too fat
17/06/2021, 21:33 - Théodore Bedos: I can't beleive that you fit all your room in your mum's car
17/06/2021, 21:33 - Gracou: Not all of it
17/06/2021, 21:33 - Gracou: I left quite a bit hahaha
17/06/2021, 21:33 - Gracou: I will move it to my new house like I said
17/06/2021, 21:37 - Théodore Bedos: That makes sens
17/06/2021, 21:41 - Gracou: Home!
17/06/2021, 21:50 - Théodore Bedos: Youpiiii
17/06/2021, 21:51 - Théodore Bedos: I told my friends about you and he said that he rarely saw me as happy than when I was talking about you
17/06/2021, 22:17 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
17/06/2021, 22:17 - Gracou: Baby these are so stunning I think I like them even more than my birthday flowers😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
17/06/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: And you remembered I liked baby’s breath!
17/06/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: You’re so so thoughtful I’m so so lucky thank you baby❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
17/06/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: I feel very special and you have brownie points from the family members
17/06/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: That is so so sweet what were you talking about
17/06/2021, 22:19 - Gracou: I’m looking forward to seeing you in pris as well by the way❤️
17/06/2021, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: I am happy that you like them, I wish I could have shut my mouth longer ahaha
17/06/2021, 22:21 - Gracou: Hahaha
17/06/2021, 22:21 - Gracou: It was still a surprise to see which flowers that you got for me
17/06/2021, 22:23 - Gracou: Anyway what were you telling them about me!!
17/06/2021, 22:24 - Théodore Bedos: I love you babe, you are not so lucky you deserve to get all my attention
17/06/2021, 22:26 - Théodore Bedos: I was telling him that you took the time to hide a note so that I have a surprise when I come back. And that no ones except my parents ever took time to prepare me a surprise and I really love you
17/06/2021, 22:28 - Gracou: Awwww :)
17/06/2021, 22:30 - Théodore Bedos: I told him that my exams were hard and that I have very few time between work, you and sports, so I had and I will have to make a choice because I won't be able to fully do all of them. And I said that there is no doubt that sport would jump with no hesitation
17/06/2021, 22:30 - Gracou: ❤️❤️❤️
17/06/2021, 22:31 - Théodore Bedos: He was quiet surprised
17/06/2021, 22:31 - Gracou: But I don’t want you to feel bitter that you have had to sacrifice something u enjoy so much
17/06/2021, 22:31 - Théodore Bedos: I said there is no doubt
17/06/2021, 22:31 - Gracou: He was surprised u would give up sports for a girl?
17/06/2021, 22:31 - Gracou: Especially an English girl who are known to be ugly
17/06/2021, 22:32 - Théodore Bedos: No I don't, I have enough time to do all if I am organised, but if some how I have to choose because I have too much work I would always pick you
17/06/2021, 22:33 - Théodore Bedos: No he is not a macho like that, he just never knew me in love except for sport so he was surprised
17/06/2021, 22:33 - Gracou: Haha
17/06/2021, 22:33 - Théodore Bedos: What did you mean by brownie points?
17/06/2021, 22:34 - Gracou: That you go up in their opinion
17/06/2021, 22:34 - Gracou: Is the simplest explanation
17/06/2021, 22:34 - Théodore Bedos: nice
17/06/2021, 22:35 - Théodore Bedos: Which family members?
17/06/2021, 22:35 - Théodore Bedos: You?
17/06/2021, 22:35 - Gracou: All of them
17/06/2021, 22:36 - Théodore Bedos: When will you leave for Cornwall
17/06/2021, 22:36 - Gracou: They have uninvited me to the first night :(
17/06/2021, 22:37 - Gracou: So I’m now going on saturday
17/06/2021, 22:37 - Gracou: No one bothered to tell me
17/06/2021, 22:37 - Théodore Bedos: WTF
17/06/2021, 22:37 - Théodore Bedos: why
17/06/2021, 22:38 - Théodore Bedos: I mean why they uninvited you
17/06/2021, 22:38 - Gracou: Darcy has prom so couldn’t go
17/06/2021, 22:38 - Gracou: So they just uninvited me too
17/06/2021, 22:41 - Gracou: Just spoke to my dad about it
17/06/2021, 22:41 - Gracou: so Darcy told them that I would stay an extra night and then drive her down the day after
17/06/2021, 22:41 - Gracou: So my parents were like ‘okay so long as you’re both happy to do that’ thinking that Darcy and I had both spoke about it
17/06/2021, 22:42 - Gracou: And then she just didn’t even bother to say anything about it to me
17/06/2021, 22:54 - Théodore Bedos: Classic Darcy!!
17/06/2021, 22:55 - Théodore Bedos: I would be quiet pissed too
17/06/2021, 22:55 - Théodore Bedos: Couldn't she take the train?
17/06/2021, 22:56 - Gracou: Yes she certainly could
17/06/2021, 22:56 - Gracou: She also passed her driving test this week
17/06/2021, 22:56 - Gracou: So basically she wants to make everyone work around her for no reason whatsoever
17/06/2021, 22:57 - Théodore Bedos: She might be scared to drive by herself that far
17/06/2021, 22:57 - Gracou: She is too full of herself for that
17/06/2021, 22:58 - Théodore Bedos: I see
17/06/2021, 22:59 - Théodore Bedos: That's annoying, I especially understand how frustrating it is when parents are unfair between children
17/06/2021, 23:01 - Théodore Bedos: But know it's done so maybe try to stop thinking about it so that you don't have a catastrophic drive Saturday and don't start your holliday on an argue
17/06/2021, 23:01 - Théodore Bedos: *but now
17/06/2021, 23:02 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to bed, sleep well
17/06/2021, 23:02 - Gracou: Yes a little, and they certainly wouldn’t have let me drive for 2hrs by myself in my first week
17/06/2021, 23:03 - Gracou: But I don’t get anything from disadvantaging her so I’m not going to complain
17/06/2021, 23:03 - Gracou: No my dad has already thanked me for being the bigger person about it I’m not going to be grumpy
17/06/2021, 23:03 - Gracou: I hope you sleep well and have sweet dreams❤️❤️❤️ I love you
18/06/2021, 14:44 - Théodore Bedos: My turn to be top level bored
18/06/2021, 14:52 - Gracou: Ohhh baby
18/06/2021, 14:52 - Gracou: Nothing to do?
18/06/2021, 14:53 - Théodore Bedos: I have but it's boring stuff
18/06/2021, 14:53 - Théodore Bedos: like papers and emails
18/06/2021, 15:04 - Gracou: What papers?
18/06/2021, 15:07 - Théodore Bedos: Administrative papers
18/06/2021, 15:26 - Gracou: What are they babe
18/06/2021, 15:26 - Gracou: Sorry im not being very attentive I’m driving
18/06/2021, 16:06 - Gracou: Have you found something to do now? I’m guessing so :)
18/06/2021, 16:18 - Théodore Bedos: Just boring stuffs
18/06/2021, 16:18 - Théodore Bedos: Keep focussing on the road
18/06/2021, 16:19 - Gracou: I’m obviously not driving anymore
18/06/2021, 16:19 - Gracou: I wouldn’t text and drive
18/06/2021, 17:12 - Théodore Bedos: Are you arrived?
18/06/2021, 17:38 - Gracou: Yes I had to take Darcy’s friends to get their prom outfits
18/06/2021, 19:40 - Théodore Bedos: Can you show me again how you were looking at your prom

18/06/2021, 20:35 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you have multiple dresses?
18/06/2021, 20:58 - Théodore Bedos: Talk to me baby
18/06/2021, 21:11 - Gracou: Sorry baby I’m weirdly busy
18/06/2021, 21:11 - Gracou: But I literally love so much u asking for attention
18/06/2021, 21:15 - Théodore Bedos: What are you doing?

18/06/2021, 21:18 - Gracou: Sleepover avec Hannah
18/06/2021, 21:36 - Théodore Bedos: Oh alright, enjoy the night with Hannah
18/06/2021, 21:37 - Théodore Bedos: Don't kiss her too much
18/06/2021, 21:39 - Gracou: Too late
18/06/2021, 22:01 - Gracou: I miss you ❤️
18/06/2021, 22:02 - Gracou: I had three different proms and wore different dresses to all of them
18/06/2021, 22:06 - Théodore Bedos: I love you too
18/06/2021, 22:06 - Théodore Bedos: Why three proms?
18/06/2021, 22:06 - Théodore Bedos: What's a prom actually
18/06/2021, 22:42 - Gracou: Different year groups
18/06/2021, 22:42 - Gracou: It’s like a ball for the end of your year at school
18/06/2021, 22:55 - Théodore Bedos: I would guess that the pink dresses was for the last prom
18/06/2021, 23:07 - Gracou: Why do u guess that
19/06/2021, 01:28 - Gracou: Babyyyyy as per usual I’ve been thinking about how much I adore you and think your gorgeous and so good for me and good to me and that I just want to be around you for a long time
19/06/2021, 08:21 - Théodore Bedos: I've been thinking the same. That's quiet opposite to when I said at the beginning that I knew it wouldn't last forever, but right now I don't see why there would be a limit.
19/06/2021, 08:36 - Théodore Bedos: You complete me Grace, I need you, I love you
19/06/2021, 15:05 - Gracou: I love you so much❤️
19/06/2021, 17:26 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
19/06/2021, 17:26 - Théodore Bedos: Big big storm in Paris right now
19/06/2021, 17:27 - Théodore Bedos: You can't see it much but there is thunder and lighning bolt
19/06/2021, 17:28 - Théodore Bedos: lightning bolts
19/06/2021, 17:28 - Théodore Bedos: How has been your sleep over and morning?
19/06/2021, 19:23 - Gracou: It’s lovely to see your view!
19/06/2021, 19:24 - Gracou: Yes I didn’t see the lightening bolts
19/06/2021, 19:24 - Gracou: Sorry I haven’t spoken to u I was busy packing and then driving to Cornwall
19/06/2021, 19:24 - Gracou: The sleep over with Hannah was really nice we spoke about so many things for hours and hours
19/06/2021, 19:24 - Gracou: How has your day been? Can I call you later?
19/06/2021, 19:30 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
19/06/2021, 19:30 - Gracou: Here is my view it’s not so stormy
19/06/2021, 19:32 - Théodore Bedos: Yes call me
19/06/2021, 19:33 - Théodore Bedos: I see that there is a golf court down your house
19/06/2021, 19:33 - Théodore Bedos: Is there anything to do for you there or is it just for the golf that you go?
19/06/2021, 20:24 - Gracou: Oh my gosh been here for 30 minutes and my mum is already shouting and swearing at me bc I’m trying to calm her down and we have already had to go all four of us into separate rooms
19/06/2021, 20:33 - Théodore Bedos: What happened?
19/06/2021, 20:33 - Gracou: We were sat at dinner and Darcy was being moody so my mum was getting annoyed
19/06/2021, 20:33 - Gracou: But it was the end of dinner so I just said that I wanted to say something
19/06/2021, 20:35 - Gracou: And I was just like: I’m not interested in going over everything or arguing but I feel like over the past few days there have been quite a few things where people have just planned things and assumed I will do things without mentioning it to me at all or until the last moment
19/06/2021, 20:35 - Gracou: And I said that it made me feel like a toss away person in the family so I would appreciate more communication
19/06/2021, 20:35 - Gracou: And my parents were like ‘fair enough’
19/06/2021, 20:36 - Gracou: And darcy immediately started disagreeing and saying I was trying to start and argument and receive praise blah blah blah
19/06/2021, 20:36 - Gracou: And It rlly pissed my mum off
19/06/2021, 20:36 - Gracou: She has a short temper and just will accuse everyone of everything
19/06/2021, 20:37 - Théodore Bedos: So why did every one had to go in different room if it was your mum being pissed at Darcy?
19/06/2021, 20:37 - Gracou: I can currently hear her complaining to my dad as well
19/06/2021, 20:37 - Gracou: Bc she just got pissed off at both of us
19/06/2021, 20:37 - Théodore Bedos: why you?
19/06/2021, 20:38 - Gracou: Bc she is very illogical when she is angry
19/06/2021, 20:38 - Gracou: And I tried to calm her down and she told me to fuck off and get out of her face
19/06/2021, 20:38 - Théodore Bedos: wow ok
19/06/2021, 20:39 - Gracou: Yeah so now I’m frustrated
19/06/2021, 20:39 - Gracou: Really not what I intended whatsoever
19/06/2021, 20:39 - Théodore Bedos: I couldn't expected her to be like that, she seemed so calm
19/06/2021, 20:39 - Gracou: No she has a very short fuse she just acts different in front of people outside of the family
19/06/2021, 20:40 - Gracou: I really try to help her when she is like that and she is so unreasonable
19/06/2021, 20:41 - Théodore Bedos: oh ok
19/06/2021, 20:41 - Gracou: Anyway sorry for ranting at you babe
19/06/2021, 20:41 - Théodore Bedos: What can we do now to change your mind
19/06/2021, 20:41 - Gracou: I think I’m going to shower and get into my pjamas that will make me feel better
19/06/2021, 20:42 - Gracou: I have been trying to plan what pjamas to wear when I come to France hahaha
19/06/2021, 20:43 - Gracou: So that it meets all of the criteria a) you don’t think it’s ugly and embarrassing b) but still comfortable c) not too sexy or revealing bc ur parents are around
19/06/2021, 20:45 - Théodore Bedos: We don't really stay in pyjamas in my family
19/06/2021, 20:45 - Théodore Bedos: We just stay in dressed until we go to bed and just when we go to bed or brush or teeth we get changed
19/06/2021, 20:46 - Théodore Bedos: our teeth
19/06/2021, 20:46 - Gracou: That’s so weird and uncomfortable
19/06/2021, 20:46 - Gracou: But I expected that
19/06/2021, 20:46 - Gracou: But still if I bump into them on my way to brush my teeth I shouldn’t be in a see through lace set
19/06/2021, 20:46 - Gracou: Me and rafael aren’t on that level yet
19/06/2021, 20:47 - Gracou: Unless you think it would get me brownie points and then I would definitely do it
19/06/2021, 20:48 - Gracou: ;)
19/06/2021, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: Except my sister that now belongs in trackies around, but we all think it looks like she has just been doing nothing of all day
19/06/2021, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: You won't bump in them
19/06/2021, 20:49 - Gracou: Ooo does that mean I can get away with trackies
19/06/2021, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: No that means no
19/06/2021, 20:49 - Gracou: Why wouldn’t I bump into them? How many bathrooms are there
19/06/2021, 20:49 - Gracou: You gave me hope then took it away :(
19/06/2021, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: No because it is sooooooo freaking hot that you would regrett so much wearing a tracky
19/06/2021, 20:49 - Gracou: I’m not sure if u noticed but I didn’t wear trackies the whole time we were together for 2 weeks in bath
19/06/2021, 20:50 - Théodore Bedos: I noticed and I loved it
19/06/2021, 20:50 - Gracou: And as soon as u left I put them on even tho it was too hot bc I missed them so much hahahaha
19/06/2021, 20:50 - Gracou: 👎🏿
19/06/2021, 20:51 - Théodore Bedos: No because trackies makes people look as if they are lazy
19/06/2021, 20:51 - Théodore Bedos: And I don't want  you to look like that
19/06/2021, 20:51 - Théodore Bedos: in front of my parentds
19/06/2021, 20:52 - Théodore Bedos: There is two bathroom you wouldn't bump into someone
19/06/2021, 20:52 - Gracou: This is good
19/06/2021, 20:52 - Théodore Bedos: And you would hear if someone is around
19/06/2021, 20:52 - Gracou: I was worried I would have no poop privacy
19/06/2021, 20:52 - Gracou: Oh then maybe not
19/06/2021, 20:52 - Théodore Bedos: There is two bathroom and two toilets
19/06/2021, 20:53 - Gracou: Is there good poop privacy
19/06/2021, 20:53 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
19/06/2021, 20:53 - Théodore Bedos: And no
19/06/2021, 20:53 - Gracou: Oh
19/06/2021, 20:53 - Théodore Bedos: I mean I think yes because the toilet is a the end of the corridor, but if you compare to you house then it is quiet close to the living room
19/06/2021, 20:54 - Théodore Bedos: But that is just like in any appartment
19/06/2021, 20:54 - Gracou: Yes I see
19/06/2021, 20:54 - Théodore Bedos: For an appartement it is well poop private
19/06/2021, 20:54 - Gracou: Whenever I need to poop I could just force u to take me to a cafe and do it there hahaha
19/06/2021, 20:55 - Gracou: I think that is a good poop plan
19/06/2021, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: Have you ever pooped in my appartement in Bath?
19/06/2021, 20:55 - Gracou: Otherwise I will just wait for everyone to fall asleep
19/06/2021, 20:55 - Gracou: I think I haven’t
19/06/2021, 20:55 - Gracou: It was too close to the kitchen
19/06/2021, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: It is much further
19/06/2021, 20:55 - Gracou: U know that time I hurt my toe and we were having Nando’s
19/06/2021, 20:56 - Théodore Bedos: And their are two, so you have tactical options
19/06/2021, 20:56 - Théodore Bedos: Oh yes I remember that lunch
19/06/2021, 20:56 - Gracou: The reason I couldn’t eat it, felt sick and was dizzy was bc I needed to poop so badly
19/06/2021, 20:56 - Gracou: This is a valid point
19/06/2021, 20:56 - Théodore Bedos: Why did you just not poo
19/06/2021, 20:56 - Gracou: Bc u were literally eating right next to the toilet how rude
19/06/2021, 20:57 - Gracou: And I had been holding it for so long I knew it would be rlly audible
19/06/2021, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: You are the one who don't understand why I am shy after I poo and you go in the toilet
19/06/2021, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: so I thaught you wouldn't be poo shy
19/06/2021, 20:57 - Gracou: And u were just telling me how u thought our relationship wouldn’t last hahaha I was on thin ice and didn’t want to break it
19/06/2021, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: Ahahaha
19/06/2021, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: did you took it bad?
19/06/2021, 20:58 - Gracou: When u said that? No
19/06/2021, 20:58 - Gracou: I took it as a challenge
19/06/2021, 20:58 - Gracou: And also logical bc I think the same way
19/06/2021, 20:58 - Gracou: But I still wanted to prove u wrong
19/06/2021, 20:58 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah you seemed to agree
19/06/2021, 20:58 - Théodore Bedos: we made fun of bennas after
19/06/2021, 20:58 - Gracou: I’m poo shy only in certain situations
19/06/2021, 20:59 - Gracou: Yes I wasn’t lying I did agree
19/06/2021, 20:59 - Gracou: Anyway we were making fun of benas for saying I was the love of his life and you said that to me before u left bath
19/06/2021, 20:59 - Gracou: Sometimes these things aren’t logical
19/06/2021, 20:59 - Théodore Bedos: Did I said it?
19/06/2021, 21:00 - Gracou: Yes u did
19/06/2021, 21:00 - Gracou: And I said ‘really?!’ And u said so far
19/06/2021, 21:00 - Théodore Bedos: In what context?
19/06/2021, 21:00 - Théodore Bedos: ahaha oh yes
19/06/2021, 21:00 - Théodore Bedos: that's what I thaught
19/06/2021, 21:00 - Théodore Bedos: that doesn't look like me not to precise so far
19/06/2021, 21:00 - Gracou: Pardon?
19/06/2021, 21:01 - Théodore Bedos: That's so mean, I am laughing right now
19/06/2021, 21:01 - Théodore Bedos: sorry
19/06/2021, 21:01 - Théodore Bedos: I love you
19/06/2021, 21:01 - Gracou: Wait I’m confused
19/06/2021, 21:01 - Théodore Bedos: I said
19/06/2021, 21:02 - Théodore Bedos: That's what I thought (that I had precised by adding 'so far')
19/06/2021, 21:02 - Gracou: Riight
19/06/2021, 21:03 - Gracou: And u think it’s mean that u thought that?
19/06/2021, 21:03 - Théodore Bedos: It's mean to say that it didn't look like me to say that
19/06/2021, 21:03 - Gracou: Hahaha
19/06/2021, 21:04 - Théodore Bedos: I love you so much, but looking back at it I find it a bit too cheesy
19/06/2021, 21:04 - Théodore Bedos: And I am surprised to have said that
19/06/2021, 21:04 - Gracou: You find it too cheesy?
19/06/2021, 21:05 - Théodore Bedos: Not that I don't think it, just that it is not my style to say it
19/06/2021, 21:05 - Gracou: I was surprised when u said it
19/06/2021, 21:05 - Gracou: U can tell from my ‘really?!’
19/06/2021, 21:05 - Gracou: I agree it’s not ur style
19/06/2021, 21:05 - Théodore Bedos: Am I the man of your life?
19/06/2021, 21:05 - Gracou: But that made me think that it was sweet
19/06/2021, 21:06 - Gracou: Theodore don’t ask things like that
19/06/2021, 21:06 - Théodore Bedos: ahaha
19/06/2021, 21:06 - Gracou: Especially not over WhatsApp
19/06/2021, 21:06 - Théodore Bedos: why?
19/06/2021, 21:06 - Gracou: Next thing u know u will be proposing to me over FaceTime
19/06/2021, 21:07 - Gracou: The best things should be said in person
19/06/2021, 21:07 - Théodore Bedos: After what you said this morning I actually wanted to ask "where is my ring then"
19/06/2021, 21:07 - Gracou: Hahaha
19/06/2021, 21:07 - Gracou: Where is mine
19/06/2021, 21:07 - Théodore Bedos: You said first that you wanted to stay with me for long
19/06/2021, 21:08 - Théodore Bedos: where is my ring then
19/06/2021, 21:08 - Gracou: Long is open to interpretation
19/06/2021, 21:08 - Gracou: 30 minutes in the microwave might be long to cook noodles
19/06/2021, 21:08 - Gracou: You said forever
19/06/2021, 21:09 - Gracou: Which is longer than even the longest time as it is infinite
19/06/2021, 21:09 - Gracou: Therefore where is my ring
19/06/2021, 21:09 - Théodore Bedos: I said that I don't see the limit
19/06/2021, 21:09 - Théodore Bedos: I don(t see it but it might be right at the corner
19/06/2021, 21:10 - Gracou: You have perfect sight tho and a working neck which can look sideways
19/06/2021, 21:10 - Gracou: Around corners
19/06/2021, 21:10 - Théodore Bedos: Talking about rings, what is your finger size, might be usefull one day
19/06/2021, 21:11 - Théodore Bedos: and jean size
19/06/2021, 21:11 - Théodore Bedos: and top size
19/06/2021, 21:11 - Théodore Bedos: and shoe size
19/06/2021, 21:11 - Théodore Bedos: And boobs size
19/06/2021, 21:11 - Gracou: Depends on the finger
19/06/2021, 21:11 - Gracou: XXXL (fat booty)
19/06/2021, 21:11 - Théodore Bedos: it is
19/06/2021, 21:11 - Gracou: Aged 9 (kids section)
19/06/2021, 21:12 - Gracou: The same as Cinderella’s
19/06/2021, 21:12 - Gracou: About the same size as ur hand
19/06/2021, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: I laughed at all of them
19/06/2021, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: well done
19/06/2021, 21:12 - Gracou: Hahaha
19/06/2021, 21:12 - Gracou: I’m proud
19/06/2021, 21:13 - Théodore Bedos: seriously now
19/06/2021, 21:13 - Gracou: Okay one minute I will have to work it out and I want to put my clothes away x
19/06/2021, 21:20 - Gracou: So
19/06/2021, 21:20 - Gracou: I think for ring sizes I would need to be measured again to tell u
19/06/2021, 21:21 - Gracou: But I think that I was around an M or N but that is for the middle finger on my left hand and all of my fingers are different
19/06/2021, 21:21 - Gracou: Jean size I think probably a waist 25
19/06/2021, 21:22 - Gracou: Top size is small or XS which is about a 6 or an 8 depending on how u want it to fit
19/06/2021, 21:22 - Gracou: Shoe size is 5 or 5.5
19/06/2021, 21:23 - Gracou: Boobs size is 32 B
19/06/2021, 21:25 - Théodore Bedos: What's the length in jeans?
19/06/2021, 21:25 - Théodore Bedos: I have never seen that kind of mesure for fingers
19/06/2021, 21:25 - Gracou: No clue
19/06/2021, 21:25 - Gracou: How do u measure fingers?
19/06/2021, 21:25 - Théodore Bedos: I do it in mm normally
19/06/2021, 21:26 - Théodore Bedos: like around 50 to 66
19/06/2021, 21:26 - Gracou: Well I can measure my fingers in mm when I’m home and have a measuring tape
19/06/2021, 21:28 - Théodore Bedos: No no it's ok, you normally do it in a shop with a specific tool
19/06/2021, 21:28 - Théodore Bedos: and then you try to remember it
19/06/2021, 21:28 - Théodore Bedos: Which I never do and then ask evry time
19/06/2021, 21:28 - Gracou: Yes I got measured in a shop to get the M N
19/06/2021, 21:28 - Gracou: But I just don’t remember and ask every time like you :)
19/06/2021, 21:29 - Théodore Bedos: English and units....😅
19/06/2021, 21:29 - Gracou: French and thinking their better than the English......😬
19/06/2021, 21:31 - Théodore Bedos: The whole word using the same measurements.... except english
19/06/2021, 21:33 - Gracou: The whole world not being able to perform to the level of sophistication of the English measurements.... especially the french
19/06/2021, 21:36 - Théodore Bedos: Me knowing that there is no measurement for how much I love you ...😍
19/06/2021, 21:38 - Gracou: This is a very good reply
19/06/2021, 21:38 - Gracou: You win the argument
19/06/2021, 21:38 - Gracou: ❤️❤️❤️
19/06/2021, 21:43 - Gracou: I am being very immature
19/06/2021, 21:43 - Théodore Bedos: why?
19/06/2021, 21:43 - Gracou: This is a picture Darcy shared with our family in her very beautiful prom dress

19/06/2021, 21:53 - Gracou: Nope
19/06/2021, 21:53 - Gracou: It hasn’t been proven to me so I can’t agree
19/06/2021, 21:54 - Théodore Bedos: You'll see at the weeding then

19/06/2021, 21:56 - Gracou: Poor Tom
19/06/2021, 21:56 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry I thought I would make you laugh
19/06/2021, 21:56 - Gracou: Do U think Tom will change his name to joe on the wedding papers or just stick to Tom? Who knows
19/06/2021, 21:57 - Théodore Bedos: AHAHHAHAHA
19/06/2021, 21:57 - Gracou: Make me laugh by saying Tom?
19/06/2021, 21:57 - Gracou: Hahahaha
19/06/2021, 21:57 - Théodore Bedos: I forgot it was Joe until you said it
19/06/2021, 21:57 - Théodore Bedos: I laughed at loud
19/06/2021, 21:57 - Gracou: When u said that u were trying to make me laugh I thought u meant that u did it on purpose
19/06/2021, 21:57 - Gracou: Hahahhahaha
19/06/2021, 21:58 - Théodore Bedos: No I thought I would make you laugh by intentionally forgetting to mention joe and disha's after saying wedding
19/06/2021, 21:58 - Théodore Bedos: But I didn't realise that I got the name wrong
19/06/2021, 21:58 - Gracou: No u just made me very panicked
19/06/2021, 21:58 - Gracou: But it was funny that U got the name wrong
19/06/2021, 21:59 - Théodore Bedos: On my invitation paper he should definatly change his name to Tom
19/06/2021, 21:59 - Gracou: Yh maybe u would remember him then
19/06/2021, 22:00 - Gracou: Maybe he will think ur named Francis and send the invitation to someone completely different
19/06/2021, 22:01 - Théodore Bedos: Do you think that I will receive one or will it just be one to you with the option to come with a partner
19/06/2021, 22:02 - Gracou: Probably that
19/06/2021, 22:02 - Gracou: But it depends on if u get closer
19/06/2021, 22:02 - Gracou: It would probably be addressed to me and then say to bring theo
19/06/2021, 22:06 - Théodore Bedos: So I am just your partner to them, I am so offended
19/06/2021, 22:07 - Gracou: At the moment probably
19/06/2021, 22:07 - Gracou: But after more time with them it
Might be different
19/06/2021, 22:07 - Théodore Bedos: I am just joking I know that, it's ok
19/06/2021, 22:08 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I was watching the snap you sent me, and just above was you holding your boobs and smilling, I just couldn't watch it too long so much it makes me miss you
19/06/2021, 22:09 - Gracou: Wait let me check to see which video u mean
19/06/2021, 22:10 - Gracou: Ahhh I see

19/06/2021, 22:17 - Gracou: I definitely do
19/06/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: I should spray something with my perfume it’s very enjoyable
19/06/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: Actually sometimes it makes me too sad
19/06/2021, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: I should have get something from you
19/06/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: I’m trying to do my french lessons so sorry if my replies are slow for a bit
19/06/2021, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: goofd
19/06/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: Yes but u didn’t ask
19/06/2021, 22:19 - Théodore Bedos: Babe did you had this talk you needed to have with your parents about coming to france
19/06/2021, 22:19 - Théodore Bedos: You told me you had to talk to them when I told you that you should take the tickets
19/06/2021, 22:19 - Gracou: Oh fuck that makes me remember something
19/06/2021, 22:21 - Gracou: I have spoken with my parents
19/06/2021, 22:21 - Gracou: So now all I need to do is confirm the time I pick up my keys
19/06/2021, 22:22 - Gracou: But I have to phone them to book the appointment so have to wait until Monday
19/06/2021, 22:23 - Théodore Bedos: What was this discussion about?
19/06/2021, 22:23 - Gracou: Idk they honestly didn’t say much
19/06/2021, 22:24 - Gracou: I just told them what I planned and they said that it sounded like a nice holiday hahaha how pointless of them
19/06/2021, 22:27 - Théodore Bedos: Fair enough
19/06/2021, 22:27 - Gracou: Sorry about that I will book an appointment on Monday and then I can book the train and my pcr
19/06/2021, 22:27 - Gracou: Are u worried?
19/06/2021, 22:29 - Théodore Bedos: No no I just really wanna see you and so I just want it to happen
19/06/2021, 22:29 - Théodore Bedos: When do you want to leave?
19/06/2021, 22:29 - Gracou: What do u mean?
19/06/2021, 22:30 - Gracou: The time of day?
19/06/2021, 22:30 - Théodore Bedos: I mean leave France
19/06/2021, 22:31 - Théodore Bedos: How lon do you wanna stay?
19/06/2021, 22:31 - Gracou: I get the feeling you want me to stay for more than two weeks
19/06/2021, 22:34 - Théodore Bedos: I would like yes
19/06/2021, 22:35 - Gracou: How long do you want me to say
19/06/2021, 22:35 - Gracou: Stay*
19/06/2021, 22:35 - Théodore Bedos: but you'll be the one away so I know it can be weird
19/06/2021, 22:35 - Gracou: How long do you want me to stay
19/06/2021, 22:37 - Théodore Bedos: Let say that from the 17th to the 21th we are in south of France, why don't you stay until the end of July
19/06/2021, 22:39 - Gracou: So you want me to come for almost all of July?
19/06/2021, 22:39 - Gracou: I have to come back for the 31st because I need to be in london for my old friends 21st birthday party
19/06/2021, 22:40 - Gracou: The problem as well darling is that I need to work to earn money for next term
19/06/2021, 22:41 - Gracou: And I probably can’t afford to stay in Paris that long anyway with the money I currently have x
19/06/2021, 22:44 - Gracou: When I say Paris I mean France
19/06/2021, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: Well I see but that's just a week extra than if you left the 21 and we won't stay in Paris the whole month, we would mostly be at countryside and it's cheep. Also my parents would just care for us in the sout
19/06/2021, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: in the south and in Paris depending on what we do
19/06/2021, 22:47 - Gracou: Yes but babe I don’t think it’s fair for ur parents to pay for me for things for that long
19/06/2021, 22:47 - Gracou: I will think about it but I’m just not sure
19/06/2021, 22:48 - Gracou: There has been a surprise legal fee with my flat that is 6k so I have to pay 3k that I didn’t plan for which is why i am feeling a bit poor
19/06/2021, 22:49 - Théodore Bedos: I know but they would probably just do when they are around and they will only be around if we are in Paris or if we are in the South.
19/06/2021, 22:49 - Théodore Bedos: And that doesn't changed much if you stay a week more or not
19/06/2021, 22:49 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you have to pay extra 3KKKKK?
19/06/2021, 22:50 - Gracou: Tell me about it
19/06/2021, 22:50 - Théodore Bedos: What?
19/06/2021, 22:50 - Gracou: That’s just me agreeeing that it’s annoying
19/06/2021, 22:50 - Gracou: It’s for legal fees
19/06/2021, 22:51 - Théodore Bedos: What does that mean
19/06/2021, 22:51 - Théodore Bedos: for which flat
19/06/2021, 22:51 - Gracou: The flat I bought
19/06/2021, 22:51 - Théodore Bedos: Oh the one you baught
19/06/2021, 22:51 - Théodore Bedos: I thought the one you rent
19/06/2021, 22:51 - Gracou: No no
19/06/2021, 22:52 - Théodore Bedos: I see
19/06/2021, 22:52 - Gracou: Yeah it’s made me a bit stressed
19/06/2021, 22:53 - Théodore Bedos: I just feel that I wanna see you more than 2 weeks
19/06/2021, 22:53 - Gracou: You’re supposed to be coming to the UK in august
19/06/2021, 22:54 - Théodore Bedos: Yes sure but I wanna see you more than 2 weeks straight
19/06/2021, 22:54 - Gracou: If I can do it babe then I will I just obviously don’t want to be poor next term of uni I won’t be able to treat you or enjoy myself
19/06/2021, 22:54 - Gracou: How many weeks will u come in august
19/06/2021, 22:55 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah I understand but it is just one week difference
19/06/2021, 22:56 - Théodore Bedos: I cannot tell you yet for August because I am still waiting to see if I can get a placement or not, in the UK or not.
19/06/2021, 22:57 - Gracou: So u want me to come for longer as an insurance that u will see me if u end up getting a placement in Germany and can’t come to the uk
19/06/2021, 22:58 - Théodore Bedos: No
19/06/2021, 22:59 - Théodore Bedos: I just want to see you longer than 2 weeks because I know that everyday is just better with you
19/06/2021, 22:59 - Théodore Bedos: And so I would like to have you longer with me
19/06/2021, 22:59 - Gracou: Okay
19/06/2021, 23:00 - Théodore Bedos: Even if I am in Germany I would try to come, I just don't know how long and when
19/06/2021, 23:01 - Gracou: It’s a bit inconvenient we come from different countries
19/06/2021, 23:01 - Théodore Bedos: true
19/06/2021, 23:02 - Gracou: I find ur slightly absurd french ness cute tho
19/06/2021, 23:02 - Théodore Bedos: What make you think that
19/06/2021, 23:03 - Théodore Bedos: I mean what is my slighty absurd french ness that you are talking about
19/06/2021, 23:04 - Théodore Bedos: And what did I just do to make you say that
19/06/2021, 23:08 - Gracou: Well it’s annoying that ur french  bc it means we can’t see each other at the moment
19/06/2021, 23:08 - Gracou: But on the other hand it’s nice bc ur frenchness is quite cute
19/06/2021, 23:08 - Gracou: But also a bit silly
19/06/2021, 23:09 - Gracou: Like how u are racist against fat people and won’t wear trackies to watch fb
19/06/2021, 23:09 - Gracou: Tv*
19/06/2021, 23:29 - Théodore Bedos: I am not racist to fat people
19/06/2021, 23:29 - Gracou: Yes u are
19/06/2021, 23:29 - Théodore Bedos: Nope
19/06/2021, 23:30 - Théodore Bedos: I just think it is unnatractive
19/06/2021, 23:30 - Théodore Bedos: I don't dislike them
19/06/2021, 23:30 - Gracou: Okay
19/06/2021, 23:33 - Gracou: When did the party start?
19/06/2021, 23:33 - Théodore Bedos: There is actually not 7 people but 4 finally and they arrived at 9
19/06/2021, 23:33 - Théodore Bedos: They are actually not so loud
19/06/2021, 23:34 - Théodore Bedos: They play cards and board games, last time they were putting music veryloud and siinging 2010 classics
19/06/2021, 23:40 - Gracou: Hahaha
19/06/2021, 23:40 - Gracou: Did they put dernier dance or whatever it’s called on
19/06/2021, 23:41 - Théodore Bedos: Hell no, it's a classic for no one
19/06/2021, 23:42 - Gracou: Darcy put it on in the car today and actually sang the lyrics ahahahhaha
19/06/2021, 23:44 - Théodore Bedos: Honestly I am not joking there is noooo one that would appreciate this song in Frnace. Even my sister with her shite music taste wouldn't like it
19/06/2021, 23:44 - Théodore Bedos: And trsut me she listen to bad stuff
19/06/2021, 23:45 - Gracou: Hahaha

19/06/2021, 23:47 - Théodore Bedos: and my sister is like Darcy not sure you would like her much
19/06/2021, 23:48 - Théodore Bedos: Quiet princess
19/06/2021, 23:49 - Théodore Bedos: On the point of Darcy that you don't like
19/06/2021, 23:49 - Gracou: Wdym on the point of Darcy?
19/06/2021, 23:52 - Théodore Bedos: Like she doesn't have a job, she just ask my parents to get her things and just think everything is due to her.
19/06/2021, 23:52 - Théodore Bedos: We already had this conversation babe
19/06/2021, 23:52 - Théodore Bedos: Like they are the same for receiving gift at christmad
19/06/2021, 23:53 - Gracou: I know I know
19/06/2021, 23:53 - Gracou: But weirdly I think this might make me find her funny bc she is so like Darcy
19/06/2021, 23:53 - Théodore Bedos: Curious to see it
19/06/2021, 23:54 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to go to bed babe
19/06/2021, 23:54 - Gracou: Okay baby

19/06/2021, 23:54 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
19/06/2021, 23:55 - Gracou: That would be fun but maybe in the evening?

20/06/2021, 00:09 - Gracou: It was a large proportion of my face
20/06/2021, 00:10 - Théodore Bedos: lying to you is not being supportive

20/06/2021, 00:11 - Gracou: I don’t think that is what she meant
20/06/2021, 00:11 - Gracou: U didn’t even tolerate it u deleted it anyway
20/06/2021, 00:12 - Théodore Bedos: Babe on your instagram how many pictures of your nose, just your bottom lip and a quarter of each eye did you post?
20/06/2021, 00:12 - Gracou: Ce message a été supprimé.

20/06/2021, 00:19 - Gracou: I was continuing the conversation on Snapchat go read
20/06/2021, 13:17 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
20/06/2021, 13:17 - Gracou: At the spa
20/06/2021, 13:36 - Théodore Bedos: What kind of care are you doing?
20/06/2021, 13:36 - Gracou: I just had a massage
20/06/2021, 13:36 - Gracou: I needed some physical affection
20/06/2021, 13:42 - Théodore Bedos: I see
20/06/2021, 13:42 - Théodore Bedos: You'll have some soon
20/06/2021, 13:42 - Théodore Bedos: did you enjoy?
20/06/2021, 13:43 - Théodore Bedos: Was it a foot massage?
20/06/2021, 13:43 - Gracou: Yes I love some foot touching u know me so well
20/06/2021, 13:44 - Gracou: I did enjoy but I used to get a massage every month so I’m very used to having a lot of pressure (more so than u would normally do on someone my size) and I find it much nicer and more relaxing to have a lot of pressure
20/06/2021, 13:45 - Gracou: And I asked the girl to increase the pressure twice and she didn’t which is annoying
20/06/2021, 13:45 - Gracou: She told me at the end it was bc she wanted it to be relaxing but I relax much more when the massage is intense
20/06/2021, 13:58 - Théodore Bedos: I see
20/06/2021, 13:59 - Théodore Bedos: How come did you use to get a massage once a month?
20/06/2021, 14:00 - Théodore Bedos: I'll remember you that you like pressure next time you'll say that I am too heavy when I do the walrus on you
20/06/2021, 14:00 - Gracou: I used to get acupuncture every month and she always gave me a massage after
20/06/2021, 14:00 - Gracou: That’s not pressure babe that’s smushing
20/06/2021, 14:01 - Théodore Bedos: Why were you having accumponcture?
20/06/2021, 14:01 - Théodore Bedos: Accupuncture
20/06/2021, 14:02 - Gracou: To try and help my CVS
20/06/2021, 14:02 - Théodore Bedos: I see I see

20/06/2021, 14:03 - Gracou: It’s a very small prick
20/06/2021, 14:04 - Gracou: Are u bad at getting ur blood taken?
20/06/2021, 14:04 - Théodore Bedos: I hate it
20/06/2021, 14:11 - Gracou: Oh baby it’s not so bad
20/06/2021, 14:17 - Théodore Bedos: I know but I still hate it

20/06/2021, 15:40 - Gracou: Well done for being brave x
20/06/2021, 15:45 - Théodore Bedos: Oh I really don't care of the liquid I just really don't like needle
20/06/2021, 15:45 - Théodore Bedos: But yeah I was brave, I had a teddy bear plaster and a candy
20/06/2021, 16:14 - Gracou: Not a hello kitty one?! So brave!
20/06/2021, 19:03 - Théodore Bedos: What have you been up to after your massage

21/06/2021, 13:14 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I am ok no worries, i am used to be bored. And I am fine because I know that it is temporary, I will see you soon. The years before that was making me bing eating a lot because I was very sad, but it's different now.

21/06/2021, 20:29 - Gracou: I was hoping to show u later to see what u think x I got her something that was a specialty of a place sort of since u recommended it
21/06/2021, 20:44 - Théodore Bedos: Why don't you tell me what it is?
21/06/2021, 20:44 - Théodore Bedos: The weird  or local stuff it is more for my father, not really my mum thing
21/06/2021, 20:47 - Gracou: Oh well it doesn’t matter I can not give it to her it wasn’t too expensive
21/06/2021, 20:47 - Gracou: U will think it is weird if I explain it
21/06/2021, 20:48 - Gracou: It is like two Cornish shells with gold around them so they are attached together to open and close and hold jewellery or something
21/06/2021, 20:48 - Gracou: But it is quite small
21/06/2021, 20:48 - Gracou: Like a bit smaller than the palm of my hand
21/06/2021, 20:48 - Gracou: I just thought of her when I saw it but it might be silly I won’t be offended
21/06/2021, 20:49 - Gracou: But the shell is kind of shiny
21/06/2021, 20:49 - Gracou: Anyway I will show u when I’m home
21/06/2021, 20:50 - Théodore Bedos: Oh I thought it was local food, but that sounds cute, that's definatly more for her
21/06/2021, 20:51 - Théodore Bedos: Where are you tonight?
21/06/2021, 20:53 - Gracou: A hotel restaurant
21/06/2021, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: I just played basketball 2hours with a french actor I am quiet fan of

21/06/2021, 21:14 - Théodore Bedos: before leaving
21/06/2021, 21:16 - Théodore Bedos: We played some 3 vs 3, winner stay on the field, and we won 6 games in a row, which never happen normally. It was crazy, everyone wanted to beat our team and we just play crazy good. The actor was in my team

21/06/2021, 22:22 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
21/06/2021, 22:23 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

21/06/2021, 22:58 - Gracou: Got spot I wondered if u would remember
21/06/2021, 23:03 - Théodore Bedos: It was so crazy outside, I have seen a crowd of 2000 people wearing absolutely no mask and doing a big pogo
21/06/2021, 23:03 - Théodore Bedos: The actor is called Fabrice Éboué
21/06/2021, 23:04 - Gracou: A pogo?
21/06/2021, 23:05 - Gracou: Ahh cool

21/06/2021, 23:28 - Gracou: I’m glad you like them :)
21/06/2021, 23:31 - Gracou: Are u sad to be missing out on the festival?
21/06/2021, 23:34 - Théodore Bedos: No I am not sad really, I just wish you were their because the ambiance was amazing

21/06/2021, 23:36 - Gracou: Thank you for reminding me I had forgotten since dinner
21/06/2021, 23:39 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
21/06/2021, 23:39 - Gracou: What do you think of this? (Darcy’s birthday is on the 5th)
21/06/2021, 23:40 - Gracou: I don’t massively feel the need to stay for it but my parents are pressuring me
21/06/2021, 23:40 - Gracou: But I will be in bath on the 1st and 2nd so will probably struggle more to get a test on the weekend anyway? I would love to hear what u think
21/06/2021, 23:41 - Gracou: That would be more than three weeks so obviously please make sure your parents are okay with that
21/06/2021, 23:45 - Théodore Bedos: It's up to you babe, of course I would prefer you to come the soonest like the 2 or 3, like that you could easily take a test the thursday or friday, but if you feel that it is too long or that you need to be at darcy's birthday, it's all good
21/06/2021, 23:45 - Théodore Bedos: Yes their would be no problem for you to be here that much
21/06/2021, 23:46 - Gracou: have you checked with them?
21/06/2021, 23:46 - Gracou: Also I need to be in bath until the 2nd and then I have to take the car back to Devon
21/06/2021, 23:46 - Théodore Bedos: Right now they are in bed, but I discussed dates with them befor and they are completly fine
21/06/2021, 23:47 - Gracou: If I left on the 3rd it would be a lot to manage to take the test while managing the bath stuff so then that would put me on the fourth, which might seem
A bit rude that I won’t just stay an extra day for Darcy’s birthday
21/06/2021, 23:47 - Gracou: Okay good
21/06/2021, 23:47 - Gracou: That’s obviously a really long time and they might not like me when I get there so I want to be sure they won’t mind
21/06/2021, 23:49 - Théodore Bedos: They really won't mind, and my father already appreciate you, also we won't be in the same house than them most of the time
21/06/2021, 23:49 - Gracou: Oooo rafael appreciates me
21/06/2021, 23:49 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know, but it seems easier to do the test when you are in Bath and near Bristol than when you'll be back to Denbury
21/06/2021, 23:50 - Théodore Bedos: (I don't know about the dates, not about Raphael)
21/06/2021, 23:50 - Gracou: That depends I guess, but I would still have to take the car back
21/06/2021, 23:51 - Gracou: 3.5 weeks is still a long time
21/06/2021, 23:51 - Théodore Bedos: Are you gonna go by yourself in Bath?
21/06/2021, 23:51 - Gracou: Yes
21/06/2021, 23:51 - Théodore Bedos: I thought your parent didn't wanted you to drive up to Bath
21/06/2021, 23:51 - Gracou: I’m gunna have problems moving the mirror but that’s a future grace problem
21/06/2021, 23:52 - Gracou: No I’m taking my mums car
21/06/2021, 23:52 - Gracou: They don’t have a problem with my driving they just think karly will die
21/06/2021, 23:52 - Théodore Bedos: Why don't you go with your mom to help you, and then she comes back alone and you go from Bath?
21/06/2021, 23:53 - Gracou: No because I need to do a lot of cleaning and it will waste her time for two days
21/06/2021, 23:53 - Gracou: She wouldn’t do it and would be very angry the whole time if she did
21/06/2021, 23:53 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway babe do as you want, I don't want to force yourself to come earlier, so do when you'll be happy
21/06/2021, 23:54 - Gracou: U might be very sick of me after 2.5 weeks and regret wanting me to come for longer
21/06/2021, 23:54 - Théodore Bedos: Hell no
21/06/2021, 23:54 - Gracou: Hell yes
21/06/2021, 23:54 - Gracou: I can’t not wear trackies for 3.5 weeks I don’t have the strength
21/06/2021, 23:54 - Gracou: You will deffo want to put me on a train
21/06/2021, 23:55 - Théodore Bedos: I don't think so, but clearly you don't want to so just do what is okay for you
21/06/2021, 23:56 - Gracou: Ugh babe don’t be silly
21/06/2021, 23:56 - Gracou: Ur being like a grumpy teenager
21/06/2021, 23:56 - Théodore Bedos: I am trying to simplify it for you
21/06/2021, 23:56 - Gracou: Saying ‘clearly you don’t want to’ so I will give u lots of affection and say otherwise
21/06/2021, 23:58 - Gracou: Imagine how annoying it’s going to be next term when we don’t want to spend a single night apart but we are fighting every time over whos house we stay at :)
21/06/2021, 23:59 - Théodore Bedos: I don't really think about it
21/06/2021, 23:59 - Théodore Bedos: I think it will be nice
21/06/2021, 23:59 - Gracou: I only just thought of it
21/06/2021, 23:59 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you need to stay 2 days in Bath?
22/06/2021, 00:00 - Gracou: I think we will annoy all of our flat mates while discussing it
22/06/2021, 00:00 - Gracou: Because I have to pick up the keys at 4pm
22/06/2021, 00:00 - Gracou: So I will spend the 1st cleaning my current house and packing up
22/06/2021, 00:00 - Gracou: Then I will move everything into the new house on the second and drive back then
22/06/2021, 00:01 - Gracou: Otherwise I will be driving late at night
22/06/2021, 00:02 - Théodore Bedos: One the first day, clean pack and moves the stuff, sleep there and so you can just drive when you wake up on the 2nd
22/06/2021, 00:02 - Théodore Bedos: Then you can just take a train in the afternoon and arrive in the evenning in Paris
22/06/2021, 00:03 - Gracou: Maybe
22/06/2021, 00:05 - Théodore Bedos: But the ticket is at 100euro if you take it in the afternoon like that, it has increased since last time I think
22/06/2021, 00:06 - Théodore Bedos: if you take the 6th it is 68 euros
22/06/2021, 00:06 - Gracou: For a single or return?
22/06/2021, 00:06 - Théodore Bedos: For the first single, then 56 euro for the return the 30th
22/06/2021, 00:07 - Gracou: Ah i see
22/06/2021, 00:07 - Gracou: Would U not buy them together? U would buy them seperately?
22/06/2021, 00:08 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
22/06/2021, 00:10 - Gracou: I was on the website before but didn’t look at the prices yet 😁
22/06/2021, 00:10 - Gracou: Thank you for staying up and checking when u want to be asleep
22/06/2021, 00:11 - Théodore Bedos: It's ok babe
22/06/2021, 00:12 - Théodore Bedos: The 6th is cheaper, if it's easier also, you should take it
22/06/2021, 00:13 - Théodore Bedos: But that means that you leave a tuesday, so you need to find a test where you get the result in 24h because you would have to do it on the monday
22/06/2021, 00:13 - Gracou: Hmm yes you’re right
22/06/2021, 00:13 - Théodore Bedos: But you don't need a PCR like I did, I did because I was in a rush. I think you can do others cheaper options now
22/06/2021, 00:14 - Théodore Bedos: At boots if you book now you can have an antigen test that is enough
22/06/2021, 00:14 - Théodore Bedos: I will check for you
22/06/2021, 00:14 - Gracou: Aww baby you’re so helpful
22/06/2021, 00:15 - Gracou: If only I could have been so helpful when u had to do it
22/06/2021, 00:15 - Théodore Bedos: It's ok babe, thanks
22/06/2021, 00:16 - Gracou: You don’t have to check it tho darling I left my debit card at home by accident so I will have to wait until my dad is up tomorrow to borrow his card anyway x
22/06/2021, 00:16 - Gracou: I can check it tomorrow
22/06/2021, 00:20 - Théodore Bedos: Ok let's do that
22/06/2021, 00:20 - Théodore Bedos: I'm going to bed
22/06/2021, 00:20 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my love
22/06/2021, 00:20 - Gracou: Je t’aime bonne nuit
22/06/2021, 00:20 - Gracou: Mon cœur ❤️
22/06/2021, 00:21 - Gracou: I attempted french I hope it worked
22/06/2021, 00:22 - Théodore Bedos: C'était parfait
22/06/2021, 00:22 - Gracou: Yayyy
22/06/2021, 00:23 - Gracou: Bon rêve
22/06/2021, 00:23 - Gracou: I made that up does it make sense
22/06/2021, 00:23 - Gracou: I meant to say sweet dreams that was the closest I could think of
22/06/2021, 00:24 - Théodore Bedos: Yes but 'fais de bon rêves' is more accurate
22/06/2021, 00:24 - Gracou: Ah he’s this sounds better
22/06/2021, 00:24 - Gracou: Merci prof
22/06/2021, 00:25 - Gracou: Funny how u say ‘do good dreams’
22/06/2021, 00:25 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry it is, 'Fais de beaux rêves'
22/06/2021, 00:25 - Théodore Bedos: do pretty dreams
22/06/2021, 00:25 - Gracou: Yeah better haha
22/06/2021, 00:25 - Gracou: At least u knew what I was trying to say❤️
22/06/2021, 13:34 - Théodore Bedos: Babe, have you checked the conditions for going to France?
22/06/2021, 13:34 - Gracou: Not yet x
22/06/2021, 13:35 - Théodore Bedos: I think you won't be able to come
22/06/2021, 13:36 - Théodore Bedos: If you are not vaccined, you are not allowed to come to France except if you are French, have a specific Visa or some other exeptions
22/06/2021, 13:36 - Gracou: I can get vaccinated
22/06/2021, 13:42 - Gracou: Are you okay u look upset?
22/06/2021, 13:42 - Théodore Bedos: I am fine
22/06/2021, 13:43 - Théodore Bedos: Just annoyed by this thing
22/06/2021, 13:45 - Gracou: Im really upset about it
22/06/2021, 13:45 - Gracou: I have been really excited to come :(
22/06/2021, 13:45 - Gracou: I will try to find a loop hole
22/06/2021, 13:49 - Gracou: I have an idea but I will have to check it can work
22/06/2021, 13:49 - Théodore Bedos: South Ireland is a green country, Same as any European country, it should be fine if you come from there, but I am worried that you need a test made in the green country
22/06/2021, 13:49 - Gracou: Toby lives in south Ireland that could work
22/06/2021, 13:50 - Gracou: But I need to get there too so will have to check that
22/06/2021, 13:51 - Gracou: I was guessing as another idea (but I’m trying to check on the french website) that they might let me travel if I have a job in France - and then we could pretend I’m employed by your mum? Idk that is a bit tentative but just an idea
22/06/2021, 13:53 - Théodore Bedos: I already thought about it and no it doesn't work, that is not in the list of exceptions. You would need to study in France or be a doctor, or have visa etc...
22/06/2021, 13:54 - Théodore Bedos: Spain doesn't have ask for test apparently
22/06/2021, 13:55 - Gracou: Yes Darcy just suggested studying
22/06/2021, 13:55 - Gracou: I could do a french language course
22/06/2021, 13:55 - Gracou: So I could go from Spain?
22/06/2021, 13:56 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it's a green country as any European country
22/06/2021, 13:56 - Gracou: We can get married and then I will have a green card
22/06/2021, 13:56 - Théodore Bedos: It's going to be complicated if we're not in the same country
22/06/2021, 13:56 - Théodore Bedos: I'm pretty sure we need to be at the same place to be married
22/06/2021, 13:57 - Gracou: Hahahahaha
22/06/2021, 13:57 - Gracou: Do u know I’m joking
22/06/2021, 13:58 - Théodore Bedos: Of course!
22/06/2021, 13:58 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't want to call
22/06/2021, 13:59 - Gracou: You sounded like you were taking it seriously
22/06/2021, 14:00 - Théodore Bedos: Yes that was the joke
22/06/2021, 14:00 - Gracou: Suuuuuure
22/06/2021, 14:01 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, taking some lessons might be a solution but I am not sure that you could easily find a french academy or something that is matching your travel dates and that would accept you in a 2 weeks delay
22/06/2021, 14:02 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe a summer language camp or something
22/06/2021, 14:02 - Théodore Bedos: But it might be a lot more expensive than just travelling from Spain, Belgium, or Ireland
22/06/2021, 14:02 - Théodore Bedos: Is Disha still in Spain?
22/06/2021, 14:03 - Gracou: Disha is in Dubai at the moment but she will probs be back by the 6th
22/06/2021, 14:06 - Théodore Bedos: Because you could easily go their, stay a night at hers or more the time to take a test from Spain and then come to France. I could maybe even join you
22/06/2021, 14:06 - Gracou: Yes I think it makes sense to go to Spain
22/06/2021, 14:06 - Gracou: Especially since disha won’t be there for 3rd year it will be nice to see her
22/06/2021, 14:07 - Théodore Bedos: Or do the same with Toby, which might be cheaper to travel to
22/06/2021, 14:08 - Théodore Bedos: But yeah Spain seems a valid option.
22/06/2021, 14:11 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
22/06/2021, 14:11 - Théodore Bedos: If you don't take too long to do it, you can found some quiet cheap tickets from Barcelona to Paris on the 6th
22/06/2021, 14:12 - Théodore Bedos: So you might not loose to much if you do that
22/06/2021, 14:12 - Théodore Bedos: You can then easily come back from Paris to England by the Eurostar
22/06/2021, 14:32 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
22/06/2021, 14:32 - Théodore Bedos: On the 3rd you can fly for nothing from London STN to Barcelona
22/06/2021, 14:32 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
22/06/2021, 14:33 - Théodore Bedos: And on the 4th you can take the 45euro flight to Barcelona from London Gathewick if it is easier
22/06/2021, 14:33 - Théodore Bedos: I actually don't know what is the easiest airport for you to fly from, Bristol had no direct flight and it was expensive
22/06/2021, 15:02 - Gracou: Babe❤️❤️❤️
22/06/2021, 15:02 - Gracou: I really love you
22/06/2021, 15:03 - Théodore Bedos: Ahaha, I am happy to help you
22/06/2021, 15:03 - Théodore Bedos: I love you to
22/06/2021, 15:26 - Gracou: No I think it’s rlly sweet that u go to all that effort
22/06/2021, 15:26 - Gracou: And that I could have convinced u to marry me for a free card
22/06/2021, 15:26 - Gracou: Green*
22/06/2021, 15:27 - Théodore Bedos: You are joking right?
22/06/2021, 15:27 - Gracou: Yes
22/06/2021, 15:27 - Théodore Bedos: ok
22/06/2021, 15:28 - Théodore Bedos: Did Disha told you if she will be in Spain around those dates?
22/06/2021, 15:28 - Gracou: I only just returned from
My lunch with Darcy so I’m going to ask her now x
22/06/2021, 15:28 - Théodore Bedos: Fair enough
22/06/2021, 15:29 - Gracou: Did that piss u off
22/06/2021, 15:30 - Théodore Bedos: No not at all, but I wanted to be sure that you didn't think I am stupid enough to take it seriously😅
22/06/2021, 15:30 - Gracou: I don’t think ur stupid babe
22/06/2021, 15:30 - Gracou: But I did think u where taking it seriously haha
22/06/2021, 15:31 - Théodore Bedos: No I didn't
22/06/2021, 15:40 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
22/06/2021, 15:40 - Gracou: I think u would have loved my lunch
22/06/2021, 15:42 - Théodore Bedos: Seems delicious🤤
22/06/2021, 16:05 - Théodore Bedos: But before even asking Disha if she would welcome you, would you be happy with his option if she is ok? Like would you be ok to take the plane alone? And do a longer trip?
22/06/2021, 16:05 - Gracou: I have already asked her
22/06/2021, 16:06 - Gracou: I will take the plane alone if I have to in order to see you babe x
22/06/2021, 16:24 - Théodore Bedos: 🥰
22/06/2021, 16:24 - Théodore Bedos: Wanted to check that you were confortable with this
22/06/2021, 16:24 - Théodore Bedos: I don't want to pressure you
22/06/2021, 16:30 - Gracou: Thanks baby I appreciate it x
22/06/2021, 16:37 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
22/06/2021, 16:37 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
22/06/2021, 16:42 - Théodore Bedos: 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
22/06/2021, 16:42 - Théodore Bedos: So hot babe
22/06/2021, 16:44 - Gracou: 😁

22/06/2021, 16:45 - Théodore Bedos: I do to
22/06/2021, 18:24 - Théodore Bedos: Babe you are so hot honestly, every time I am opening my whatsapp I see these two pictures and I am just wowwww
22/06/2021, 18:24 - Théodore Bedos: no words
22/06/2021, 18:28 - Gracou: That makes me really happy
22/06/2021, 19:20 - Gracou: I’m just double checking the dates with disha rn xo
22/06/2021, 19:25 - Théodore Bedos: OK
22/06/2021, 19:26 - Théodore Bedos: Ask me if you need, I am available
22/06/2021, 19:30 - Gracou: I will stay with her from the 4th to the 7th I think it is rude to have only one full day
22/06/2021, 19:31 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah of course, I thought the same and I wouldn't mind if you would like to stay more
22/06/2021, 19:31 - Gracou: And thanks btw
22/06/2021, 19:31 - Gracou: You wouldn’t mind?
22/06/2021, 19:31 - Gracou: I’m surprised
22/06/2021, 19:32 - Gracou: I will still have to leave France on the same date so I thought u wouldn’t like it
22/06/2021, 19:34 - Théodore Bedos: Of course I don't like it but I would understand and won't be angry at you if you would like to
22/06/2021, 19:34 - Gracou: I see :)
22/06/2021, 19:35 - Gracou: I want to be with you
22/06/2021, 19:35 - Gracou: Although if disha asks then I would stay a day more with her because I don’t want to be rude
22/06/2021, 19:37 - Théodore Bedos: I got it babe, do as you feel it's right
22/06/2021, 19:37 - Gracou: ❤️
22/06/2021, 19:37 - Gracou: I’m glad hopefully this works so that we can see eachother
22/06/2021, 19:37 - Théodore Bedos: I hope too
22/06/2021, 19:37 - Gracou: I panicked when u said I couldn’t earlier
22/06/2021, 19:38 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry
22/06/2021, 19:40 - Gracou: Don’t worry darling
22/06/2021, 19:51 - Théodore Bedos: I could even join you in Barcelona if you want to stay longer
22/06/2021, 19:54 - Gracou: Have you been invited?
22/06/2021, 19:58 - Théodore Bedos: Ahaha true
22/06/2021, 19:58 - Gracou: :):)
22/06/2021, 19:59 - Théodore Bedos: Could do an airbnb
22/06/2021, 19:59 - Théodore Bedos: I have been in holliday away for ages
22/06/2021, 19:59 - Gracou: ‘Hi disha i know we haven’t called since you left but can I stay at ur house and then also have my boyfriend there too bc I actually only want to spend time with him? Great. Thanks! My assistant will be in touch.’
22/06/2021, 20:00 - Théodore Bedos: I am just saying that to make it easier for you
22/06/2021, 20:00 - Gracou: If u would like to stay in Barcelona for a holiday that definitely sounds fun but could we do it after I spend those few days with dish?
22/06/2021, 20:01 - Théodore Bedos: of course of course
22/06/2021, 20:01 - Théodore Bedos: I was just proposing this so that you can see her longer if you wanted to
22/06/2021, 20:02 - Théodore Bedos: I am aware of how akward is it to go see her only a few days, that's why I told you that I wouldn't be pissed if you wanna stay longer
22/06/2021, 20:02 - Gracou: Well we can also hang
With her after we have gone to the b&b
22/06/2021, 20:03 - Théodore Bedos: And I didn't know that you didn't message her since she left
22/06/2021, 20:04 - Gracou: I mean I get a holiday to a different country either way so it’s up to u hahahap
22/06/2021, 20:04 - Gracou: I can have a look at some b&bs if u like
22/06/2021, 20:06 - Théodore Bedos: I don't understand
22/06/2021, 20:06 - Théodore Bedos: You said it was a bad idea and now you say that...
22/06/2021, 20:23 - Gracou: No no I have messaged we just haven’t spoken on a phone call
22/06/2021, 20:23 - Gracou: I said what was a bad idea?
22/06/2021, 20:29 - Théodore Bedos: You said this, that didn't seem like you were welcoming well my idea
22/06/2021, 20:31 - Gracou: Not to stay at her house
22/06/2021, 20:33 - Gracou: But to stay in a b&b wouldn’t be rude
22/06/2021, 20:36 - Théodore Bedos: Ah ok because you said that after that I said that I could stay at a rbnb
22/06/2021, 20:37 - Gracou: We could stay together at a bnb if u wanted a holiday
22/06/2021, 20:38 - Théodore Bedos: We can check
22/06/2021, 20:40 - Théodore Bedos: But we might need to check also how much it costs to do a valid test in Spain because if it is 200 pounds like I did in England that is quiet a lot for 3 days
22/06/2021, 20:41 - Gracou: This is true
22/06/2021, 20:56 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
22/06/2021, 20:56 - Gracou: This was the lentilly thing my mum made tonight it made me think of u
22/06/2021, 20:57 - Gracou: Also I literally took one bite (I found out later I just at straight haluumi’ and then was so grossed out I just made myself a pizza
22/06/2021, 20:58 - Gracou: But this then made me worried that ur parents are going to hate me and think I’m rude bc what if they served me that
22/06/2021, 21:20 - Théodore Bedos: Don't stress, they will like you
22/06/2021, 21:21 - Gracou: But my eating habits are not endearing
22/06/2021, 21:21 - Gracou: Will i be able to eat ur mums food or do u think I will be difficult
22/06/2021, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: It will be fine
22/06/2021, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: Don't worry
22/06/2021, 21:23 - Gracou: Okay good
22/06/2021, 21:27 - Gracou: I feel like u are sick of me mentioning it
22/06/2021, 21:29 - Théodore Bedos: No but if you keep thinking it is going to be bad it is less likely that you will end up liking it
22/06/2021, 21:33 - Gracou: Noo I think I will like it
22/06/2021, 21:33 - Gracou: Ur dad wasn’t difficult at all
22/06/2021, 22:25 - Théodore Bedos: So what did Disha said about your idea of going in Barcelona?
22/06/2021, 22:25 - Théodore Bedos: Firstly you alone
22/06/2021, 23:39 - Théodore Bedos: So you are showing your feet in Instagram that's a big step
22/06/2021, 23:39 - Gracou: It isn’t so bad bc I’m in control of the situation
22/06/2021, 23:39 - Gracou: But I was waiting for u to comment on it hahaha
22/06/2021, 23:40 - Gracou: Unusual for me to even be chilling with bare feet
22/06/2021, 23:40 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
23/06/2021, 18:24 - Théodore Bedos: Don't forget to start watching Loki the new épisode is tonight
23/06/2021, 18:24 - Gracou: I was just thinking about that
23/06/2021, 18:25 - Gracou: But I will have to do it at home bc Hannah logged into her account on my tv
23/06/2021, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: You can log in mine

23/06/2021, 18:59 - Gracou: Okay okay :)
23/06/2021, 19:27 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
23/06/2021, 19:28 - Théodore Bedos: A nice french song, maybe you'll like it
23/06/2021, 19:29 - Gracou: I will give it a listen
23/06/2021, 19:29 - Gracou: What is it about
23/06/2021, 19:29 - Théodore Bedos: Searching sensations
23/06/2021, 19:36 - Gracou: I’m not sure what that means
23/06/2021, 19:36 - Gracou: Maybe I will look at the translation
23/06/2021, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: Look at the lyrics translation
23/06/2021, 19:42 - Gracou: That was my plan
23/06/2021, 19:44 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
23/06/2021, 19:44 - Théodore Bedos: I never care of lyrics
23/06/2021, 19:44 - Gracou: A direct quote from Theodore bedos
23/06/2021, 19:44 - Théodore Bedos: I'm surprise that it matters to you
23/06/2021, 19:44 - Gracou: I enjoy literature
23/06/2021, 19:45 - Théodore Bedos: What? Why is that a quote from me?
23/06/2021, 20:10 - Gracou: ‘ I am invincible. I’m the best surfer. I’m going to ruin u on the wave’
23/06/2021, 20:27 - Théodore Bedos: I don't get it, where did you found these 2 quotes
23/06/2021, 20:44 - Gracou: The first one is in the song, the second one I paraphrased
23/06/2021, 21:17 - Théodore Bedos: That's not what it means
23/06/2021, 21:18 - Théodore Bedos: That's not competitive like that, it means, don't try to break my pleasure when I am loving it because you are jealous
23/06/2021, 21:19 - Gracou: I see
23/06/2021, 21:57 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
23/06/2021, 21:58 - Gracou: Ur le plus beau?
23/06/2021, 21:58 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
23/06/2021, 21:59 - Gracou: Perfect
23/06/2021, 21:59 - Théodore Bedos: You know what it means le plus beau ?
23/06/2021, 21:59 - Gracou: The more beautiful one?
23/06/2021, 22:00 - Gracou: It’s how I knew it was you😏
23/06/2021, 22:00 - Théodore Bedos: Yep
23/06/2021, 22:00 - Gracou: My french is getting better
23/06/2021, 22:05 - Théodore Bedos: Nice
23/06/2021, 22:26 - Théodore Bedos: Don't forget to take your tickets 😉
23/06/2021, 22:26 - Théodore Bedos: I'm going to bed, good night pretty woman
23/06/2021, 22:27 - Gracou: I didn’t know I needed to have my passport with me soi can’t :/
23/06/2021, 22:27 - Gracou: Good night sexy man
23/06/2021, 22:29 - Théodore Bedos: I thought it was only for registration once you have bought the tickets.
23/06/2021, 22:30 - Théodore Bedos: I hope it is not gonna increase by the end of the week
23/06/2021, 22:41 - Gracou: Me too
23/06/2021, 22:42 - Gracou: I asked Darcy to find my passport to take a picture but she couldn’t
23/06/2021, 22:58 - Gracou: I finished episode 1 it is good
23/06/2021, 22:58 - Gracou: It definitely got better as it went along though, in the begining I felt that Tom hiddleston was over-acting
24/06/2021, 08:54 - Théodore Bedos: Oh ok, I didn't feel it that way, I think it is just that at the beginning because all the surrounding is very new and unknown he is the only thing we can refer to and so it amplify its actions. But it didn't made me feel uncomfortable at all. I actually really appreciate the character and his extravagance, so when it's amplified it makes me think about the Joker and I like it even more
24/06/2021, 08:55 - Théodore Bedos: I found Owen Wilson really good aswell
24/06/2021, 08:58 - Théodore Bedos: Was your room in the special after Grace setting? If it was the case, for having been in this situation, I can understand that she didn't find it...😂
24/06/2021, 10:44 - Gracou: Yes yes I agree I think he is a very extravagant character I just think i saw it too much as Tom hiddleston acting rather than Loki reacting if that makes sense
24/06/2021, 10:45 - Gracou: Owen Wilson was deffo good
24/06/2021, 10:45 - Gracou: Hahaha no she was looking in the office downstairs
24/06/2021, 10:54 - Théodore Bedos: When do you think that you'll arrive on the 7th? Because I can have my second vaccine at 16h that day
24/06/2021, 10:55 - Gracou: Im not sure baby
24/06/2021, 10:57 - Théodore Bedos: Ok
24/06/2021, 10:58 - Gracou: I will let you know when I know :£
24/06/2021, 10:58 - Gracou: :)$
24/06/2021, 10:58 - Gracou: Oh my gosh
24/06/2021, 10:58 - Gracou: I’m just trying to type a smiley face
24/06/2021, 10:59 - Théodore Bedos: No your trying to pass a subliminal message about money
24/06/2021, 10:59 - Gracou: I have no id€a what ur talking about
24/06/2021, 20:30 - Gracou: Baby! How was your day?
24/06/2021, 20:31 - Gracou: I’m at a restaurant so my replies might not be very quick sorry xoxo
24/06/2021, 21:36 - Théodore Bedos: Did some sports and basketball, but I sprained a little bit my ankle
24/06/2021, 21:36 - Théodore Bedos: Hope it's not too bad
24/06/2021, 21:36 - Théodore Bedos: How was your?
24/06/2021, 21:53 - Gracou: Baby not again :(
24/06/2021, 21:53 - Gracou: No famous people?
24/06/2021, 21:53 - Gracou: The weather was rubbish for most of the day then quite nice
24/06/2021, 21:53 - Gracou: I did lots of reading
24/06/2021, 21:55 - Théodore Bedos: No famous people but to guys that were in my primary school 11 years ago
24/06/2021, 21:56 - Théodore Bedos: It took me time to recognise them, he only recognise me when I was defending on him while playing
24/06/2021, 21:58 - Théodore Bedos: The weather is perfect here ,22 degrees, no clouds, a bit of wind
24/06/2021, 21:58 - Gracou: They didn’t recognise you? Do u not normally exchange names?
24/06/2021, 21:58 - Théodore Bedos: Did you equalised your tanning during your long reading?
24/06/2021, 21:58 - Gracou: Do u think it’s very British of me to mention the weather so often?
24/06/2021, 21:59 - Théodore Bedos: No, they recognised me first
24/06/2021, 21:59 - Gracou: No I was reading
When the weather was bad unfortunately
24/06/2021, 21:59 - Théodore Bedos: I took longer
24/06/2021, 21:59 - Théodore Bedos: No, never thought about it
24/06/2021, 21:59 - Gracou: But I tried to even out my
Tan unsuccessfully
24/06/2021, 21:59 - Gracou: Interesting
24/06/2021, 22:00 - Gracou: So did they mention it to u?
24/06/2021, 22:00 - Théodore Bedos: Of course, then I recognised them and we talked
24/06/2021, 22:00 - Gracou: That’s nice
24/06/2021, 22:01 - Gracou: I suppose they gas changed a lot
24/06/2021, 22:01 - Gracou: They were still good friends?
24/06/2021, 22:04 - Théodore Bedos: One of them had changed a lot, the other one not too much but he was 1 year younger so I didn't know him much. I was surprised and proud that the younger one remembered me so well
24/06/2021, 22:14 - Théodore Bedos: What did you get at the restaurant?
24/06/2021, 22:32 - Gracou: One minute I will cal
You❤️
24/06/2021, 23:30 - Théodore Bedos: https://youtu.be/TjkGdSiQo0A
24/06/2021, 23:30 - Théodore Bedos: It's in English actually
24/06/2021, 23:37 - Gracou: I finished talking if u still wanted to chat but I would guess you should probably sleep❤️
24/06/2021, 23:43 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to bed baby

24/06/2021, 23:44 - Gracou: I love you sleep well❤️
24/06/2021, 23:44 - Gracou: I feel sorry that our conversations aren’t as they normally are :/ I hope you don’t like me less
24/06/2021, 23:49 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I love you so much that I could spend the whole call not saying a word, just watching you, I would be happy
24/06/2021, 23:49 - Théodore Bedos: Don't worry
24/06/2021, 23:49 - Gracou: Me too baby
24/06/2021, 23:50 - Gracou: But I am sorry that it’s a bit more difficult and I can’t do much to make it easier
24/06/2021, 23:50 - Théodore Bedos: It's not difficult
24/06/2021, 23:50 - Théodore Bedos: It's a pleasure every time

25/06/2021, 11:08 - Théodore Bedos: Yes of course, I told you that it is one of my favourite place  because it is on the top of a hill and you can see all of Paris from it. I am planning to bring you there
25/06/2021, 11:08 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you ask
25/06/2021, 11:10 - Gracou: It’s one of my mums favourite places for the same reasons and she said that I should go :)
25/06/2021, 11:12 - Théodore Bedos: I use to bike all the way to the top because it is so much stip
25/06/2021, 11:12 - Théodore Bedos: The sunset is very pretty from there
25/06/2021, 11:13 - Gracou: Why would you bike all the way to the top if it is so steep
25/06/2021, 11:13 - Théodore Bedos: Because that's a challange
25/06/2021, 11:14 - Théodore Bedos: Also it is not concret road, it is old stone Parisian roads so it's even harder
25/06/2021, 11:16 - Théodore Bedos: Cobblestone
25/06/2021, 11:16 - Gracou: Yes that sounds very very difficult
25/06/2021, 11:17 - Théodore Bedos: It's nice we will go
25/06/2021, 11:31 - Gracou: I’m sure it would be so lovely to sit there at sunset with you
25/06/2021, 13:09 - Théodore Bedos: Drive safe baby
25/06/2021, 14:56 - Gracou: I’m still on the beach in Cornwall bit thank you xo

25/06/2021, 19:27 - Gracou: Ur a good son babe
25/06/2021, 19:28 - Gracou: The weather was extremely nice, we had a good breakfast at a restaurant and had ice creams and read on my favourite beach
25/06/2021, 19:28 - Gracou: One of my favourite beaches at least
25/06/2021, 19:28 - Gracou: So it was a very nice day
25/06/2021, 19:29 - Gracou: I’m really into my book at the moment, I guess you wouldn’t know so much bc I don’t read during term time but it’s a big hobby of mine haha
25/06/2021, 19:29 - Gracou: I wonder why I was the weird kid in school
25/06/2021, 19:29 - Théodore Bedos: That sounds like a very nice
25/06/2021, 19:29 - Théodore Bedos: I saw that you had a few books in bath
25/06/2021, 19:30 - Théodore Bedos: I wondered how come I never saw you read
25/06/2021, 19:30 - Gracou: I had some of the less pretty ones hidden too haha
25/06/2021, 19:30 - Théodore Bedos: or you never mentionned it
25/06/2021, 19:30 - Gracou: I feel to guilty about reading for fun when I’m studying most of the time bc I feel like I should be reading about my subject
25/06/2021, 19:31 - Gracou: And I wouldn’t exactly pull out a book and read a chapter with you around
25/06/2021, 19:31 - Théodore Bedos: And that's not weird to like reading, that is quiet respected in France if you do
25/06/2021, 19:31 - Théodore Bedos: I see what you mean about reading about another subject, I feel the same
25/06/2021, 19:32 - Théodore Bedos: What are you reading now?
25/06/2021, 19:33 - Gracou: Memoirs of a geisha
25/06/2021, 19:34 - Gracou: I think I mentioned that I find Asian culture interesting but I had never really read any books involving it before so that’s fun
25/06/2021, 19:34 - Gracou: I amarine a lot of the actors from my tv shows as the people in the book haha
25/06/2021, 19:34 - Gracou: Imagine*
25/06/2021, 19:36 - Gracou: What do you like to read? Just about fitness and business?
25/06/2021, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah, I don't like to read about fictions or stuff that does teach me stuff, basically I like to learn more than to read.
25/06/2021, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: Not really fitness, I really like sport prefomance and also biochemistry
25/06/2021, 19:40 - Théodore Bedos: Tell me about your book
25/06/2021, 19:40 - Gracou: I feel like I learn a lot from fiction actually
25/06/2021, 19:40 - Théodore Bedos: What does it talks about
25/06/2021, 19:40 - Gracou: I thought I would sum it up by saying fitness sorry haha
25/06/2021, 19:40 - Théodore Bedos: does'nt teach me s
25/06/2021, 19:40 - Gracou: The book is about a girl who’s parents are dying and she and her sister are sold
25/06/2021, 19:40 - Théodore Bedos: Doesn't teach me stuff*
25/06/2021, 19:41 - Gracou: Her sister is sold as a prostitute and she is sold to be a geisha bc she is very pretty
25/06/2021, 19:42 - Gracou: Geisha is sort of like a prostitute for the purpose of this summary but they are actually more like entertainers though music and dance and most of the time men just pay for them to talk to them and keep them company at parties
25/06/2021, 19:42 - Théodore Bedos: I know what a geisha is
25/06/2021, 19:42 - Gracou: Sorry I wasn’t sure
25/06/2021, 19:42 - Théodore Bedos: No worry
25/06/2021, 19:43 - Gracou: Anyway I’m not sure how thorough to be but it follows a lot of her life
25/06/2021, 19:43 - Gracou: She is specially trained by one of the most famous geisha and becomes one of the most famous geisha herself
25/06/2021, 19:43 - Gracou: She is very clever
25/06/2021, 19:43 - Théodore Bedos: In which country does it happen?
25/06/2021, 19:44 - Gracou: Japan
25/06/2021, 19:44 - Gracou: In a district called Gion In Tokyo
25/06/2021, 19:44 - Théodore Bedos: Based on real fact or is it a fiction?
25/06/2021, 19:44 - Gracou: No it’s real
25/06/2021, 19:44 - Gracou: It’s a memoir
25/06/2021, 19:44 - Théodore Bedos: What time?
25/06/2021, 19:45 - Gracou: She has changed parts of it so that u can’t tell who the people are but apart from that it’s supposedly real
25/06/2021, 19:45 - Gracou: Uhm at the moment I think we are in the 1930s ish
25/06/2021, 19:45 - Gracou: 1939
25/06/2021, 19:45 - Gracou: But she is born in 1920 and it starts when she is a child
25/06/2021, 19:45 - Théodore Bedos: Oh wow I thought it would be older
25/06/2021, 19:46 - Gracou: Yes she reflects on it kind of as if it’s a dead art now
25/06/2021, 19:46 - Théodore Bedos: How come did you start reading this?
25/06/2021, 19:46 - Gracou: It’s my mother’s favourite book so she bought it for me for xmas
25/06/2021, 19:54 - Théodore Bedos: What do you like in it?
25/06/2021, 19:55 - Gracou: Hmm
25/06/2021, 19:55 - Gracou: She has an interesting use of metaphor that is accessible while still unexpected
25/06/2021, 19:56 - Gracou: And that means that she is able to describe things ive never seen without taking ages to do it which I like
25/06/2021, 19:57 - Gracou: Tom Hardy for example is very good at describing things but he just takes a whole page to do it and it’s a bit much
25/06/2021, 19:58 - Gracou: I also obviously like the story, I like reading about women outsmarting heavily patriarchal or misogynistic constructs
25/06/2021, 19:58 - Gracou: It’s what I chose to sort of specialise in when I studied English for a level
25/06/2021, 19:59 - Gracou: Which is quite funny because it makes me sounds like an agressive nazi feminist even though I’m not
25/06/2021, 20:08 - Théodore Bedos: No not at all you don't sound like a an agressive feminist, it's very important to matter about that. I have one sister that is an agressive feminist and one other that don't care/ take advantage of that shitty system like it is, so I value that you care and I can recognise that you aren't extrem
25/06/2021, 20:08 - Théodore Bedos: Tom Hardy? Do you mean the actor?
25/06/2021, 20:09 - Gracou: There is also a very famous British writer called Tom hardy haha
25/06/2021, 20:09 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry, I have big lack in English culture
25/06/2021, 20:10 - Gracou: Don’t worry I have a big lack in french culture
25/06/2021, 20:10 - Gracou: Jo doesn’t care about that stuff at all?
25/06/2021, 20:20 - Théodore Bedos: She doesn't seem to care, take a comparaison with my older sister for example, we had an argue me and my older sister, where she was saying that at prime time on TV it was only men football games because the TV was ruled by men and they were deciding what should be on the main channel, and I was saying that it is wasn't a matter of men or women but just a matter of numbers so that if the simpsons would attract more viewers on prime time then it would be the simpsons, and if women football had shown promessing numbers on other channel that would show that if it was on prime time it would do more views than men football then it would be women football on prime time.  On the other hand, when it was the women Euro cup in France 2 years ago, I asked my sister why she wasn't watching a single game, and that it would be a good act of support just to show interest for the development of equality. She just said that she didn't give a fuck.
25/06/2021, 20:21 - Gracou: Lol
25/06/2021, 20:21 - Théodore Bedos: She also just seems to enjoy the system like it is, she never worked hard to get things, she would just ask and pressure in her own way to get stuff. She really seems happy to profit of the be pretty, and find a man to satisfy your need (my dad, maybe a husbund later)
25/06/2021, 20:22 - Gracou: Hmm
25/06/2021, 20:23 - Gracou: There is the side argument though which is sort of like, if you create a system where it is easier for women to profit if they take advantage in that way, can you blame them for doing it?
25/06/2021, 20:24 - Gracou: I take advantage of being pretty too sometimes, disha does it all the time
25/06/2021, 20:24 - Gracou: But honestly guys can do the same thing back at us
25/06/2021, 20:24 - Gracou: I’m much more likely to want to go the extra mile to help a handsome man than a regular one
25/06/2021, 20:25 - Gracou: It’s a bit shitty I know
25/06/2021, 20:25 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't blame her for that, it is just not something I respect
25/06/2021, 20:25 - Gracou: But I also would never go so far as to expect to lean on a man for my life
25/06/2021, 20:26 - Gracou: I sort of make decisions as if I would have to be the breadwinner
25/06/2021, 20:26 - Gracou: I’m sure u take advantage of ur attractiveness babe
25/06/2021, 20:33 - Gracou: Oooo this is suspenseful
25/06/2021, 20:33 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe but honestly I don't really see how, it is much harder for a guy to use of charmes. But anyway, I don't blame to do it, the system is like that so why not taking advantage of it if you can. But if you decide to see thing like this then it's hypocritical to complain about inequalities of sex. I think there are inequalities between sexes, not as much as my older sister but I do, and that's why I don't blame but I don't respect either people who just rely on it.
25/06/2021, 20:35 - Gracou: No relying on it isn’t very progressive
25/06/2021, 20:36 - Gracou: But when I police man pulls me over I flirt with him and try to look innocent
25/06/2021, 20:46 - Gracou: Did that bother you?
25/06/2021, 20:46 - Théodore Bedos: No no no
25/06/2021, 20:47 - Théodore Bedos: I know you do
25/06/2021, 20:47 - Théodore Bedos: "Ohhh Tooooom I forgot my towell do you have one....🥺🥺🥺🥺?"
25/06/2021, 20:47 - Théodore Bedos: "Ohhh Tooooom I forgot my wine do you have one....🥺🥺🥺🥺?"
25/06/2021, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: You know how to use it
25/06/2021, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: But I never heard you being aggressive about inequalities, so you are not incoherent
25/06/2021, 21:03 - Gracou: I’m glad you’ve noticed my quirk
25/06/2021, 21:10 - Théodore Bedos: Why are you glad?
25/06/2021, 22:56 - Gracou: I was going to make the joke ‘not the first dealer ur sister has  had’ then realised it was a bit mean and she might hear me haha
25/06/2021, 23:00 - Gracou: I love youuuuuu❤️❤️❤️
25/06/2021, 23:00 - Théodore Bedos: 😍
25/06/2021, 23:01 - Théodore Bedos: Don't forget to take your tickets
25/06/2021, 23:01 - Gracou: Yes baby
25/06/2021, 23:02 - Théodore Bedos: She wouldn't have heard it, that was a good joke
25/06/2021, 23:02 - Gracou: I wanted to look at the calendar when I checked earlier so that it would seem like it wasn’t very many days until I see you when actually it is quite a while :(
25/06/2021, 23:02 - Gracou: I was surprised u didn’t seem to notice I stopped midsentqnce with a panicked look on my face
25/06/2021, 23:03 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't
25/06/2021, 23:04 - Théodore Bedos: Not that many
25/06/2021, 23:04 - Gracou: Almost 2 weeks
25/06/2021, 23:13 - Gracou: Also babe did u like the bikini pic I sent u to wake up to u didn’t say much
25/06/2021, 23:14 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I loved it, I said thanks it can only be a lovely day (if it starts like that)
25/06/2021, 23:16 - Théodore Bedos: Very hot
25/06/2021, 23:28 - Gracou: Thanks babe
26/06/2021, 11:03 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
26/06/2021, 11:03 - Gracou: Oh dear babe
26/06/2021, 11:05 - Théodore Bedos: How did you found this
26/06/2021, 11:05 - Théodore Bedos: That was in second year when I shaved my head
26/06/2021, 11:05 - Théodore Bedos: Not shaved, cut very short
26/06/2021, 11:06 - Gracou: I have only just been able to log back into Facebook
26/06/2021, 11:06 - Gracou: And there are so many bad pictures of u on there babe hahahaha
26/06/2021, 11:09 - Gracou: Baby u were so skinny
26/06/2021, 11:09 - Théodore Bedos: Like what?
26/06/2021, 11:10 - Gracou: There are just tonnes of ones that have made me laugh
26/06/2021, 11:12 - Théodore Bedos: Skinny like any kids
26/06/2021, 11:12 - Gracou: I just never imagined it
26/06/2021, 11:12 - Théodore Bedos: Don't see what makes you say that
26/06/2021, 11:12 - Gracou: And u were skinny when u started uni too
26/06/2021, 11:13 - Théodore Bedos: No I was already stronger than the other guys of my year
26/06/2021, 11:13 - Gracou: I always imagine u as manly so it’s interesting to see u looking young
26/06/2021, 11:14 - Théodore Bedos: Show me some bad ones, after 14 I didn't post any pictures, I was just tagged in them
26/06/2021, 11:15 - Gracou: Noo I’ve stopped looking now
26/06/2021, 11:16 - Gracou: Ur fashion sense improved since u started uni too
26/06/2021, 11:47 - Théodore Bedos: Honestly, these are not good pictures, I have always been good for fashion
26/06/2021, 11:48 - Gracou: I feel like I’ve hurt ur ego and it’s not even midday
26/06/2021, 11:48 - Théodore Bedos: No no it's fine
26/06/2021, 11:49 - Théodore Bedos: I agree, I was still trying to find my style, my haircut, my physique, so I wasn't at my best but for my age I had always been well dressed
26/06/2021, 11:49 - Théodore Bedos: And this are honestly not good pictures
26/06/2021, 11:50 - Gracou: Yh I was glad u don’t have the same hair as in some of the pics hahaha
26/06/2021, 11:51 - Théodore Bedos: I have called the covid test clinic in Bath so that they pay us back the 49 pounds
26/06/2021, 11:52 - Gracou: Oh good
26/06/2021, 11:52 - Gracou: Did they say how long it would take them?
26/06/2021, 11:53 - Théodore Bedos: Not really, they will invistigate
26/06/2021, 11:54 - Gracou: Ahh
26/06/2021, 14:43 - Gracou: Babe did u think about what type of dress you would like to see me in
26/06/2021, 16:19 - Théodore Bedos: Babe, anything that you feel happy to wear
26/06/2021, 16:19 - Théodore Bedos: If you have a doubt, show me a picture
26/06/2021, 16:20 - Théodore Bedos: But you need some closes for the rainy days, it happens
26/06/2021, 18:33 - Gracou: No I’m not packing I’m just curious you told me you would think about it
26/06/2021, 20:40 - Théodore Bedos: I wouldn't be able to do your luggage, I can just give you directions
26/06/2021, 20:49 - Gracou: What do u mean about that
26/06/2021, 21:01 - Théodore Bedos: That I can't tell you exactly what to wear, I can just give you tips if you hesitate
26/06/2021, 21:02 - Théodore Bedos: Have you bought your tickets?
26/06/2021, 21:09 - Gracou: Not yet
26/06/2021, 21:10 - Gracou: And that’s fine but now u can’t complain if I only wear pink flowery dresses with bows all month
26/06/2021, 21:10 - Gracou: I need to find my passport still
26/06/2021, 21:11 - Théodore Bedos: Prices are already increased, don't take too long
26/06/2021, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: I'm fine as long as you feel pretty in what you were
26/06/2021, 21:19 - Gracou: Found it yay
26/06/2021, 21:41 - Théodore Bedos: Nice
26/06/2021, 22:43 - Théodore Bedos: I love you
26/06/2021, 22:43 - Gracou: I love you to the moon and back
26/06/2021, 22:45 - Théodore Bedos: I miss you babe
26/06/2021, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: Every time I see a couple, I think about you
26/06/2021, 22:47 - Gracou: Did u just see a couple?
26/06/2021, 22:47 - Théodore Bedos: In a serie
26/06/2021, 22:47 - Gracou: Even in a series?
26/06/2021, 22:48 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
26/06/2021, 22:48 - Gracou: Awww
26/06/2021, 22:48 - Gracou: I don’t even need I prompt I still think of you all day
26/06/2021, 22:49 - Gracou: Do you have a recommendation of where to buy tickets? Or a comparison site? I’ve never booked tickets before
26/06/2021, 22:49 - Gracou: Also I just remembered I told my mum about ur priest Halloween costume hahaha
26/06/2021, 22:53 - Théodore Bedos: I go on lilligo
26/06/2021, 22:53 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
26/06/2021, 22:53 - Gracou: Babe Spain isn’t on the list
26/06/2021, 22:54 - Gracou: Oh European Union sorry
26/06/2021, 22:54 - Gracou: Panicked for a moment
26/06/2021, 22:54 - Théodore Bedos: Go on lilligo, then see which company is selling the ticket and then go on their website directly
26/06/2021, 22:54 - Gracou: Okay thanks babe
26/06/2021, 22:55 - Théodore Bedos: So that you don't pay extra fees
26/06/2021, 22:56 - Gracou: Okay baby
26/06/2021, 22:56 - Gracou: I’m double checking all the requirements for the countries
26/06/2021, 22:56 - Théodore Bedos: Why did you tell that to your mom?
26/06/2021, 22:57 - Gracou: She asked about whether you do dress up parties hahaha
26/06/2021, 23:03 - Gracou: Babe do u think I will be able to get back to the uu
26/06/2021, 23:03 - Gracou: Uk
26/06/2021, 23:03 - Théodore Bedos: Of course
26/06/2021, 23:04 - Gracou: Okay good I couldn’t find the gov page on it
26/06/2021, 23:04 - Théodore Bedos: Their is always an exception rule for the home citizens
26/06/2021, 23:04 - Gracou: Good
26/06/2021, 23:23 - Gracou: Babe I’m confused the tickets are more expensive on Ryan air than if I did it thru kilo go
26/06/2021, 23:26 - Théodore Bedos: Show me
26/06/2021, 23:27 - Théodore Bedos: And I thought that you weren't going to fly with Ryan air but with vutling
26/06/2021, 23:28 - Gracou: I’m going to go from Birmingham
26/06/2021, 23:28 - Gracou: Oh shit I need to do my french or I will lose my streak
26/06/2021, 23:28 - Gracou: I think I’m going to do research tonight so I can’t present which flights I’m thinking of getting to my parents tomorrow before I book bc they know much more about it than me
26/06/2021, 23:32 - Théodore Bedos: What?? Babe you are 20 years old, you can book a flight by yourself, their is nothing special to know about it.
26/06/2021, 23:32 - Théodore Bedos: Then
26/06/2021, 23:32 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/06/2021, 23:32 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/06/2021, 23:33 - Théodore Bedos: See it's cheaper on ryan air
26/06/2021, 23:33 - Théodore Bedos: on their website I mean
26/06/2021, 23:34 - Théodore Bedos: Oh no it's the same price, I didn't see the change of currency. But at least it is not more expensive
26/06/2021, 23:39 - Gracou: Yes my dad is the one who suggested going from Birmingham which was much easier and cheaper than the others
26/06/2021, 23:39 - Gracou: I also have to pay an extra £50 or something to take 20kg luggage
26/06/2021, 23:44 - Théodore Bedos: And so why do you need your parents for that?
26/06/2021, 23:44 - Gracou: I don’t need them
26/06/2021, 23:45 - Gracou: I would just prefer they agreed
26/06/2021, 23:45 - Gracou: Plus my mum said she would give me the money so I don’t want to by one that she doesn’t agree with
26/06/2021, 23:47 - Théodore Bedos: Oh could she disagree? 
Babe you need to progress at not doing stuffs at the last minute. That's been 2 days that your back why do you need to wait?
26/06/2021, 23:47 - Gracou: Out hasn’t been two days
26/06/2021, 23:47 - Gracou: It has been 1.25 days
26/06/2021, 23:49 - Théodore Bedos: Don't play on words, you could have done it yesterday and you could have done it all day today. And now you are investigating possibilities at midnight. It's like your french, always at the last minut.
26/06/2021, 23:50 - Gracou: It is not last minute
26/06/2021, 23:50 - Gracou: I was busy all day
26/06/2021, 23:50 - Gracou: And I find this quite silly of you to be lecturing me on when half the day on our last day together was spent on u trying to fix a problem with your travel last minute and I didn’t complain
26/06/2021, 23:51 - Gracou: When I was in bath and had nothing to do I did my french lessons before midday mostly and certainly before it was dark
26/06/2021, 23:52 - Théodore Bedos: My thing was planned way earlier and it is because it was planned way earlier that I couldn't know that they changed the delay before presenting the test the week I had to leave
26/06/2021, 23:53 - Gracou: Your English doesn’t make sense there so I don’t know what you’re saying
26/06/2021, 23:54 - Gracou: But I’m not really bothered bc u knew what I was saying and I’m not interested in having an argument arguing over what happened when
26/06/2021, 23:55 - Théodore Bedos: My plan was decided way in advance, that's why I didn't checked the new rules when they have changed it. Not because I was doing it at last minut
26/06/2021, 23:55 - Gracou: I am going to book the tickets theo don’t make me less excited by shaming me :(
26/06/2021, 23:57 - Théodore Bedos: I am not shaming you, I am making you realise that you lack of organisation on that point. Babe, I'm not shaming you, I don't want to make you feel bad don't be sill I love you, I just want to make you realise it so that you can improve.
26/06/2021, 23:58 - Gracou: I agree this is something I should improve on
27/06/2021, 00:00 - Théodore Bedos: Alright so first thing you do tomorrow, don't let me remember it to you
27/06/2021, 00:00 - Théodore Bedos: I trust you
27/06/2021, 00:01 - Gracou: You must be tired babe
27/06/2021, 00:01 - Théodore Bedos: Why
27/06/2021, 00:01 - Gracou: Bc it’s 1am
27/06/2021, 00:02 - Théodore Bedos: I'm fine
27/06/2021, 00:03 - Théodore Bedos: You didn't confirmed me that it would be the first thing you'll do
27/06/2021, 00:03 - Gracou: It probably won’t be the first thing I do
27/06/2021, 00:03 - Gracou: Which is why I didn’t confirm it
27/06/2021, 00:04 - Gracou: I could confirm I will do it before midday
27/06/2021, 00:04 - Théodore Bedos: Don't play on words, First preoccupation of the day
27/06/2021, 00:04 - Théodore Bedos: Alright 👍
27/06/2021, 00:04 - Gracou: :)
27/06/2021, 00:10 - Gracou: I didn’t like that you brought up the french thing when we were talking about booking train tickets that made it feel like an insult
27/06/2021, 00:12 - Gracou: And I’m practicing every day so that i can try not to be so rude to ur family and speak to them so that made me sad
27/06/2021, 00:16 - Gracou: I’m not trying to argue I just wanted to say how I felt
27/06/2021, 00:19 - Théodore Bedos: Babe, I am sorry that it made you feel sad. But I brought it up because I am sad that you keep pushing back in your day those things that relate to me. It seems like it is chore to book tickets to see me or to learn my language to share more things with me. I don't mind if you do that with bills, administrative papers or whatever because I do the same, but I don't feel very happy when you do that with tickets or french
27/06/2021, 00:19 - Gracou: I see baby
27/06/2021, 00:23 - Gracou: Oh I thought you were typing something that’s why I wasn’t saying anything
27/06/2021, 00:24 - Gracou: It isn’t a chore to do those things that relate to you but the tickets things does stress me out a bit I suppose which is why I wanted to take time to make sure I did the right thing
27/06/2021, 00:24 - Gracou: But I shouldn’t do it at 11pm I just didn’t want it to end up being another day later and I hadn’t started
27/06/2021, 00:25 - Gracou: I’m excited when I think that one day I will be able to speak in french to you
27/06/2021, 00:25 - Gracou: And make joe jealous bc he isn’t bothering to learn Spanish haha
27/06/2021, 00:25 - Gracou: And it motivates me to do it everyday
27/06/2021, 00:26 - Gracou: Abs I have never kept up on doing it before now bc I don’t much enjoy learning languages (it’s why I quit all of them asap)
27/06/2021, 00:26 - Gracou: But to be able to enjoy it with you makes me want to do it
27/06/2021, 00:26 - Gracou: And so that your family likes me more too
27/06/2021, 00:26 - Gracou: And they don’t tell u to run off with a french woman
27/06/2021, 00:27 - Gracou: I promise it would make no difference except from me paying more I would still make it to you in France even tho I haven’t been quick to book
27/06/2021, 00:29 - Théodore Bedos: Ok thanks, I love you
27/06/2021, 00:30 - Gracou: This is a very short reply
27/06/2021, 00:30 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know what to sya
27/06/2021, 00:31 - Théodore Bedos: They would like you even if you didn't speak french
27/06/2021, 00:31 - Gracou: Hahaha that’s not what I was thinking u had to say
27/06/2021, 00:31 - Gracou: But I think it would be rude to not try to speak their language even if they wouldn’t dislike me if I didn’t
27/06/2021, 00:31 - Théodore Bedos: I won't run with a french woman
27/06/2021, 00:32 - Gracou: And even though we definitely won’t be relying on my french haha
27/06/2021, 00:32 - Gracou: My parents make fun of me by saying that when I’m in Paris they are going to not be happy with my and tell u to run off with a french woman haha
27/06/2021, 00:33 - Gracou: But anyway I was more looking for you to indicate a sense of resolution on the point that u think I treat things related to u as a chore
27/06/2021, 00:35 - Théodore Bedos: I see that you're making efforts
27/06/2021, 00:37 - Gracou: Again not what I pictured maybe let’s just leave it
27/06/2021, 00:45 - Gracou: Good night baby
27/06/2021, 09:41 - Théodore Bedos: I am sorry to didn't say what you wanted to hear. And I felt asleep before saying you'd good night
27/06/2021, 09:42 - Théodore Bedos: So, good morning babe, wake up well!
27/06/2021, 10:39 - Gracou: No darling it’s okay I just wanted to know if u felt better about not being a chore or ur still felt bad about it
27/06/2021, 10:39 - Gracou: Good morning babe
27/06/2021, 10:48 - Théodore Bedos: I am good
27/06/2021, 10:52 - Gracou: Good
27/06/2021, 11:14 - Théodore Bedos: By the way
27/06/2021, 11:14 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
27/06/2021, 11:14 - Gracou: Babe u wanted to not remind me
27/06/2021, 11:16 - Théodore Bedos: If on ryan air you get to pay 86 pounds to have the right to carry a 20kg luggage on Vueling at Birmingham it makes the same price if you take the luggage option
27/06/2021, 11:16 - Théodore Bedos: And you can have 25kg, and it is more comfortable than ryanair
27/06/2021, 11:17 - Gracou: By vueling?
27/06/2021, 11:17 - Gracou: Thanks for finding that baby
27/06/2021, 11:19 - Théodore Bedos: Yes Vueling
27/06/2021, 11:19 - Théodore Bedos: Do you really need me more than 10kg by the way ,😂😂😂
27/06/2021, 11:20 - Gracou: Is that a serious question
27/06/2021, 12:01 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
27/06/2021, 12:02 - Gracou: Do u want me to fly to ORY?
27/06/2021, 12:04 - Théodore Bedos: Anywhere
27/06/2021, 12:04 - Théodore Bedos: I don't mind
27/06/2021, 12:04 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it was a serious question
27/06/2021, 12:05 - Gracou: Of course I will be there for a month
27/06/2021, 12:06 - Théodore Bedos: But I have washing machines every where😂😂
27/06/2021, 12:08 - Gracou: I probably took 10kg to Cornwall for the week haha
27/06/2021, 12:09 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
27/06/2021, 12:09 - Gracou: Does this work for you
27/06/2021, 12:09 - Théodore Bedos: yes
27/06/2021, 12:17 - Gracou: I booked it :)
27/06/2021, 12:18 - Théodore Bedos: 👍👍
27/06/2021, 12:40 - Théodore Bedos: I'll be there to welcome you at the airport
27/06/2021, 14:06 - Gracou: Thank you baby
27/06/2021, 14:10 - Théodore Bedos: I saw my mum DNA origines test and she is apparently 40% british
27/06/2021, 14:11 - Théodore Bedos: 29% English / 11% scotish
27/06/2021, 14:30 - Gracou: Are u patriotic now?
27/06/2021, 14:35 - Théodore Bedos: God save the Queen
27/06/2021, 14:36 - Théodore Bedos: Queen 👑 👑 Queen, cup of tea 🍵 cup of tea 🍵 Buckingham palace
27/06/2021, 16:41 - Gracou: U finally sound like a native
27/06/2021, 20:02 - Gracou: I am 5 minutes into episode 2 of Loki
27/06/2021, 20:03 - Gracou: I have decided that the variant that is killing the TVA people is just a future version of the Loki we are following
27/06/2021, 20:11 - Théodore Bedos: I am not sure of what you mean by Loki of the future?
27/06/2021, 20:12 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
27/06/2021, 20:18 - Théodore Bedos: You and your theory...😂
27/06/2021, 20:18 - Théodore Bedos: I miss so much watching anime with you
27/06/2021, 20:36 - Gracou: Me too
27/06/2021, 20:36 - Gracou: I haven’t watched any since you left
27/06/2021, 20:40 - Théodore Bedos: Not just anime, any series, I miss your theory
27/06/2021, 20:40 - Théodore Bedos: Theories
27/06/2021, 20:40 - Gracou: I find it funny that u think my theories are silly always :)
27/06/2021, 20:44 - Théodore Bedos: It's not your theories themselves, it's the fact that you tell them so quickly and that you seem so convinced about them
27/06/2021, 20:45 - Théodore Bedos: Like 5min and you are like, ok I get the whole thing, it's so obvious, it's this guy that is...
27/06/2021, 20:55 - Gracou: Hahaha
27/06/2021, 20:55 - Gracou: He is even telling Loki now ‘if anyone is me you’re me’ surely they are the same variant
27/06/2021, 20:55 - Gracou: This is very true
27/06/2021, 21:05 - Gracou: Okay so minor flaw in the prediction
27/06/2021, 21:06 - Théodore Bedos: Did you finish the episode?
27/06/2021, 21:18 - Gracou: Yes
27/06/2021, 21:18 - Gracou: I’m on episode 3 now
27/06/2021, 21:18 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry for your theory
27/06/2021, 21:18 - Théodore Bedos: 😂
27/06/2021, 21:18 - Gracou: Who knows it could happen
27/06/2021, 21:19 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't like much episode 3
27/06/2021, 21:19 - Théodore Bedos: I mean less than the others
27/06/2021, 21:20 - Gracou: I don’t like the girl very much so far
27/06/2021, 21:39 - Gracou: Yep Sylvie is annoying and cliche
27/06/2021, 21:39 - Gracou: Loki better not love her it would be weird
27/06/2021, 21:40 - Gracou: This episode is just a copy of doctor who
27/06/2021, 21:40 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
27/06/2021, 21:41 - Gracou: Literally Sylvie is doctor who
27/06/2021, 21:41 - Théodore Bedos: I have never watched doctor who
27/06/2021, 21:42 - Théodore Bedos: Why is she the same?
27/06/2021, 21:51 - Théodore Bedos: Give me 3min
27/06/2021, 22:08 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
27/06/2021, 22:13 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
27/06/2021, 23:29 - Gracou: Sleep well my love
27/06/2021, 23:54 - Théodore Bedos: Sleep well
27/06/2021, 23:55 - Théodore Bedos: 😘
27/06/2021, 23:55 - Gracou: 😘
27/06/2021, 23:55 - Gracou: I thought u had already gone to sleep
27/06/2021, 23:56 - Théodore Bedos: I had to do my bed routine et I finished a video of something
27/06/2021, 23:57 - Gracou: Ah i see
28/06/2021, 16:08 - Gracou: Babbyyyy
28/06/2021, 16:08 - Gracou: I just spoke with edie and she says that they ask if I’ve been in one of the bad countries in the last 14 days when u cross the border
28/06/2021, 16:08 - Gracou: And u can’t go if u have been in the uk in the past 14days
28/06/2021, 16:08 - Gracou: But it didn’t say that on the government websites
28/06/2021, 16:09 - Gracou: Have u heard of it?
28/06/2021, 16:13 - Gracou: The french site is in french not English so I can only check what the uk government is saying
28/06/2021, 16:13 - Gracou: Nevermind I changed it to English
28/06/2021, 16:27 - Théodore Bedos: Who is Edie?
28/06/2021, 16:28 - Gracou: U always forget edie
28/06/2021, 16:28 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
28/06/2021, 16:28 - Théodore Bedos: And why is she the one to ask about those things?
28/06/2021, 16:29 - Théodore Bedos: I mean what did she do to know about that?
28/06/2021, 16:29 - Théodore Bedos: When you cross the border in which way? You need to be more clear
28/06/2021, 16:30 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
28/06/2021, 16:30 - Gracou: I’m
Just repeating what she said to me
28/06/2021, 16:30 - Gracou: But I think she was talking about what happened to her last year so it might have changed by now
28/06/2021, 16:42 - Théodore Bedos: Yes of course, but that's part of the declaration you have to do when you come in France, like I promess that I will do a 7 days quarantaine, I promess that I wasn't in a red country in the last 14 days, etc.... But they never check those things, that's why it's a declaration on the honor
28/06/2021, 16:43 - Théodore Bedos: That's why you do your test in Spain, so that they don't know that you were in England
28/06/2021, 16:43 - Théodore Bedos: They don't check that, it's not written that you need to have a proof
28/06/2021, 16:45 - Gracou: Okay they don’t check few
28/06/2021, 16:45 - Gracou: Thanks baby
28/06/2021, 23:37 - Gracou: I can’t wait to hang out with you
28/06/2021, 23:42 - Théodore Bedos: Me too
28/06/2021, 23:43 - Théodore Bedos: Slightly more than a week left
28/06/2021, 23:50 - Gracou: Oh it just feels so far away sometimes baby
28/06/2021, 23:50 - Gracou: But we will have so much time together when I get there
28/06/2021, 23:58 - Théodore Bedos: Can't wait
29/06/2021, 00:40 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my dream girlfriend
29/06/2021, 00:48 - Gracou: Goodnight dream boyfriend
29/06/2021, 13:06 - Gracou: Babe I’ve loooked on the website but rlly don’t want to get it wrong so wanted to check with you
29/06/2021, 13:07 - Gracou: So I think I need a pcr test or an antigen test to be taken 48 hours before I land
29/06/2021, 13:07 - Gracou: Do U think that’s right?
29/06/2021, 13:09 - Théodore Bedos: Last time I checked it was a PCR in the last 72h or an antigen in the last 48h
29/06/2021, 13:12 - Gracou: Thank you baby
29/06/2021, 13:13 - Gracou: I feel like all the sites and people I speak to say different things so I don’t want to mess up
29/06/2021, 13:13 - Gracou: Do I sign the certificate of honour at the airport or do I print it and bring it with me?
29/06/2021, 13:14 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know we need to check the instructions on the France government website
29/06/2021, 13:15 - Gracou: Okay i Will Check again
29/06/2021, 13:15 - Gracou: Sorry I keep bothering you with questions
29/06/2021, 13:21 - Théodore Bedos: No no it's ok
29/06/2021, 13:22 - Théodore Bedos: Apparently, the honour declaration is only when you come from an orange country. So if you come from Spain they should only ask you for the test
29/06/2021, 13:23 - Gracou: Even though when they check my passport they will know I’ve been in the uk?
29/06/2021, 13:24 - Théodore Bedos: They shouldn't check your passeport in-between European countries
29/06/2021, 13:24 - Théodore Bedos: I think
29/06/2021, 13:24 - Théodore Bedos: And it's not written on your passport there you where
29/06/2021, 13:26 - Gracou: Okay okay
29/06/2021, 13:27 - Gracou: I would be so sad if I got into soain but couldn’t  get to France
29/06/2021, 13:42 - Théodore Bedos: Me too, but there is no other option than to try
29/06/2021, 14:07 - Gracou: I know of course
29/06/2021, 14:08 - Gracou: Babe french weddings are so weird
29/06/2021, 14:08 - Gracou: You don’t even get married in a church!
29/06/2021, 14:08 - Théodore Bedos: What??
29/06/2021, 14:09 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you say that?
29/06/2021, 14:09 - Gracou: You get married in a town hall that’s so weird
29/06/2021, 14:09 - Gracou: I was watching a french tv programme where they sell expensive properties and the son was getting married
29/06/2021, 14:09 - Gracou: And my mum explained it to me
29/06/2021, 14:11 - Théodore Bedos: Why is that weird? That's the legal wedding. Then if you are Catholic you go to a church and you get married in front of God, if you are Juish you go in a synnagog, etc...
29/06/2021, 14:12 - Théodore Bedos: Or you don't go no where else if you beleive in nothing
29/06/2021, 14:12 - Gracou: Well why should you need to even go to the town hall
29/06/2021, 14:13 - Gracou: In the uk we go straight to whichever one we want, if ur not religious u can get married on the beach or in a hall, or u can get married in a church or synagogue
29/06/2021, 14:13 - Théodore Bedos: Because the country is ruled by laws not by god
29/06/2021, 14:14 - Gracou: I feel it would ruin it to do it in a hall before hand
29/06/2021, 14:14 - Théodore Bedos: The state need to know that you are being married
29/06/2021, 14:14 - Gracou: Yes but for us u can choose
29/06/2021, 14:14 - Gracou: The state knows ur being married when we do it in a church
29/06/2021, 14:14 - Gracou: You still sign the documents
29/06/2021, 14:16 - Théodore Bedos: In France there is a rule of sin the 19th century of separation of the church and the state. The religions don't interact with the law and the law doesn't rule the church
29/06/2021, 14:16 - Théodore Bedos: So if you want you marriage to be recognised by the law you do it in front of the mair
29/06/2021, 14:16 - Théodore Bedos: Maire
29/06/2021, 14:17 - Théodore Bedos: Then if you want it to be recognised by any other organisation on a beach, in a cave or in a church, items up to you
29/06/2021, 14:17 - Théodore Bedos: It's up to you
29/06/2021, 14:17 - Gracou: I wouldn’t want to be married that way
29/06/2021, 14:18 - Gracou: Bc then the first look at the bride isn’t impactful as it should be
29/06/2021, 14:18 - Gracou: Do u not have this superstition in France?
29/06/2021, 14:18 - Théodore Bedos: No because you don't dress the same for the legal wedding than for the church
29/06/2021, 14:18 - Théodore Bedos: It's completely different
29/06/2021, 14:18 - Gracou: It’s still bad luck
29/06/2021, 14:18 - Théodore Bedos: No
29/06/2021, 14:19 - Gracou: I see it that way
29/06/2021, 14:19 - Gracou: You are supposed to not see eachother on the day of the wedding and sleep separately the night before
29/06/2021, 14:19 - Gracou: Until you both arrive at the aisle
29/06/2021, 14:22 - Théodore Bedos: Because you don't know it it's completely different ceremonies. It doesn't have to be the same day it actually doesn't even have to be in in a specific order. The Legal wedding is a lot less formal and it's a lot shorter, and you don't do a big party after. Then you can do all what you said the day after for the church wedding, you invite a lot more people and you do the big ceremony, the party, and everything
29/06/2021, 14:23 - Théodore Bedos: It's a lot simpler to get the religion out of the law
29/06/2021, 14:24 - Gracou: It’s not so bad if it’s the day before but then u have two wedding days which is still weird
29/06/2021, 14:24 - Gracou: I consider a wedding to be religious so I would still want that to be the time I was actually married
29/06/2021, 14:25 - Théodore Bedos: What about your, how can you do to be married if your husband has already divorced?
29/06/2021, 14:25 - Théodore Bedos: You couldn't because the church doesn't recognise the divorce. So how would you do to be married?
29/06/2021, 14:26 - Théodore Bedos: It's important to separate both
29/06/2021, 14:26 - Gracou: I would be disappointed
29/06/2021, 14:26 - Gracou: Bc then I wouldn’t be able to be married in a church
29/06/2021, 14:26 - Gracou: And would have to go somewhere else
29/06/2021, 14:27 - Théodore Bedos: Yes so could you get married?
29/06/2021, 14:28 - Gracou: Yes but it wouldn’t be the way I wanted
29/06/2021, 14:28 - Théodore Bedos: How could you
29/06/2021, 14:28 - Théodore Bedos: I meant, how could you
29/06/2021, 14:28 - Gracou: Then I would have to do it legally instead of in a church
29/06/2021, 14:28 - Gracou: But that would make me unhappy and I would prefer not to do it
29/06/2021, 14:30 - Théodore Bedos: Sure sure, but you see it has to be differentiated
29/06/2021, 14:31 - Gracou: No but In the uk u have the choice where u could just go straight to the church and do one ceremony and it would be recognised
29/06/2021, 14:31 - Gracou: But u can differentiate it if u want to
29/06/2021, 14:32 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway, you can see it in a way that instead of having just one wedding, now you have it in two days
29/06/2021, 14:32 - Théodore Bedos: So double more fun
29/06/2021, 14:33 - Gracou: Yes but then when is your anniversary
29/06/2021, 14:33 - Théodore Bedos: Peak the one that means the most to you
29/06/2021, 14:34 - Gracou: What if my husband disagreed
29/06/2021, 14:34 - Gracou: Then we wouldn’t be celebrating our anniversary together
29/06/2021, 14:35 - Théodore Bedos: Then if you are not even able to agree on a date with your husband, I guess you shouldn't get married
29/06/2021, 14:35 - Gracou: I think this is a bit too dramatic
29/06/2021, 14:36 - Gracou: Bc u one of us could be very religious and the other not at all but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t get married if we would be happy together
29/06/2021, 14:37 - Théodore Bedos: You'll celebrate both, double more fun
29/06/2021, 14:37 - Théodore Bedos: Babe don't be silly
29/06/2021, 14:38 - Théodore Bedos: It's really not a problem for anyone
29/06/2021, 14:38 - Gracou: Pfft
29/06/2021, 14:38 - Gracou: Do u want to do both ceremonies on the same day for your wedding?
29/06/2021, 14:38 - Théodore Bedos: No you never do it on the same day
29/06/2021, 14:39 - Gracou: Oh
29/06/2021, 14:41 - Théodore Bedos: What many people do is that you get married in town a week/month before and then you organise a nice big weddings at countryside where your family come from or where your country side house where, in a big mansion or a castle, for a week end
29/06/2021, 14:42 - Gracou: Whaaaat so much before?!
29/06/2021, 14:43 - Théodore Bedos: It depends on availabilities
29/06/2021, 14:43 - Gracou: Gosh
29/06/2021, 14:43 - Théodore Bedos: And you want time to organise both
29/06/2021, 14:44 - Gracou: Well u organise it way in advance
29/06/2021, 14:44 - Gracou: It isn’t as if u wait to do the first wedding to start planning the second one
29/06/2021, 14:46 - Théodore Bedos: Yes but you might want to have the persons of the first wedding to be at the church to and they might not be available 2 week ends in a row
29/06/2021, 14:46 - Théodore Bedos: Or some other reasons
29/06/2021, 14:47 - Gracou: I find it very strange to do it so many days apart
29/06/2021, 14:49 - Théodore Bedos: Church and state are two very different stuff
29/06/2021, 14:49 - Théodore Bedos: It doesn't mean the same at alk
29/06/2021, 14:49 - Théodore Bedos: All
29/06/2021, 14:49 - Gracou: Perhaps that is how you feel
29/06/2021, 14:50 - Gracou: I just don’t find it as romantic to do it the french way
29/06/2021, 14:51 - Théodore Bedos: You are not being very open minded, it's really not very different
29/06/2021, 14:52 - Gracou: I don’t have to agree with you darling
29/06/2021, 14:52 - Gracou: Would you want to do it the English way? Or would u prefer the french ways
29/06/2021, 14:52 - Gracou: ?
29/06/2021, 14:55 - Théodore Bedos: I don't have all the details of what it implies to have the church responsible of the legal details, so I would need more information to state my mind as you do.
But if in the ends it is the same, I wouldn't mind
29/06/2021, 14:56 - Gracou: Hmm I see
29/06/2021, 14:56 - Gracou: Well I believe what we do
29/06/2021, 14:56 - Gracou: (Baring in mind I haven’t gotten married so not 100%)
29/06/2021, 14:57 - Gracou: Is that u go to the church and say u want to get married, then u have to get a vicar to agree to marry u
29/06/2021, 14:57 - Gracou: Then the vicar tells the law that he is going to do it and requests the documents for u to sign
29/06/2021, 14:58 - Gracou: Then on ur wedding day the vicar blesses you, and then u go to a side part of the church and sign the papers then u come back in and he announces you man and wife
29/06/2021, 14:58 - Gracou: So it’s basically the same steps u just do them all at once
29/06/2021, 14:59 - Théodore Bedos: ,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 and that's what you call more romantic 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣
29/06/2021, 14:59 - Théodore Bedos: Signing paper during the ceremony???,🤣🤣🤣
29/06/2021, 14:59 - Théodore Bedos: Very romantic 👍👍👍
29/06/2021, 15:00 - Gracou: 🙄
29/06/2021, 15:00 - Gracou: That isn’t the romantic part u silly billy
29/06/2021, 15:01 - Gracou: But it’s nice to leave the church as man and wife
29/06/2021, 15:01 - Gracou: It’s the first time I would write my new surname to change it so in a way it’s romantic
29/06/2021, 15:02 - Théodore Bedos: In France you would arrive in the church and the ceremony won't be interrupted until the end
29/06/2021, 15:03 - Gracou: It isn’t an interruption it’s part of the ceremony
29/06/2021, 15:03 - Gracou: And your family sings while you sign it’s very cultish
29/06/2021, 15:03 - Gracou: A great vibe
29/06/2021, 15:04 - Gracou: I know exactly what face u will make when u see ur fiancé at the end of the isle
29/06/2021, 15:05 - Gracou: Oops wait nevermind u would have seen her like 40mins before hand so there would be no surprise
29/06/2021, 15:11 - Théodore Bedos: Why would I have seen her 40 min before?
29/06/2021, 15:13 - Gracou: For the legal ceremony😁
29/06/2021, 15:13 - Théodore Bedos: It is not the same day, and not at all the same dress
29/06/2021, 15:14 - Gracou: Still
29/06/2021, 20:04 - Gracou: Guess who is all soppy for you
29/06/2021, 20:26 - Théodore Bedos: You?
29/06/2021, 20:27 - Gracou: Correct
29/06/2021, 20:27 - Théodore Bedos: What does Soppy means?
29/06/2021, 20:27 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
29/06/2021, 20:43 - Gracou: Did you get what I meant?
29/06/2021, 20:43 - Théodore Bedos: Yes and no
29/06/2021, 20:43 - Théodore Bedos: I think I get it, like it means sentimental
29/06/2021, 20:44 - Théodore Bedos: But I wasn't sure if there was a sexual meaning? Like if you were wet or something
29/06/2021, 20:44 - Gracou: No baby
29/06/2021, 20:44 - Gracou: Hahahahhahaga
29/06/2021, 20:44 - Gracou: Not quite getting it

29/06/2021, 21:02 - Gracou: Are u being bitter that I’m on a date with someone else?
29/06/2021, 21:02 - Théodore Bedos: The octopus of your friends looks delicious
29/06/2021, 21:02 - Théodore Bedos: I love octopus
29/06/2021, 21:02 - Gracou: Yeah I tried it it was nice
29/06/2021, 21:02 - Théodore Bedos: No I am not bitter at qll

29/06/2021, 21:03 - Gracou: I tried a muscle too
29/06/2021, 21:03 - Gracou: It was gross
29/06/2021, 21:03 - Gracou: Oh not a muscle
29/06/2021, 21:03 - Gracou: An oyster
29/06/2021, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: I don't like oyster
29/06/2021, 21:40 - Gracou: Neither hahahah
29/06/2021, 21:40 - Gracou: I spit it in a bucket
29/06/2021, 21:48 - Théodore Bedos: Where are you having dinner? Is it far from your house?

30/06/2021, 07:42 - Théodore Bedos: How come did you go to bed at 4, and woke up at 8?
30/06/2021, 07:42 - Gracou: I’m probably going to go back to sleep
30/06/2021, 07:42 - Gracou: I have woken up drunk
30/06/2021, 07:43 - Théodore Bedos: Oh so you drank with Hannah?
30/06/2021, 07:43 - Gracou: A lot

30/06/2021, 07:43 - Théodore Bedos: Explain
30/06/2021, 07:43 - Gracou: We are sleeping in a wooden hut where she works
30/06/2021, 07:43 - Gracou: I think it’s the staff room
30/06/2021, 07:44 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
30/06/2021, 07:44 - Gracou: We where in the hot tub
30/06/2021, 07:45 - Théodore Bedos: How did you end up in a hot tub?
30/06/2021, 07:45 - Gracou: Bc I wanted to go in so slowly convinced everyone it was a good idea
30/06/2021, 07:46 - Théodore Bedos: Who were the others persons?
30/06/2021, 07:46 - Gracou: The people Hannah works with
30/06/2021, 07:46 - Gracou: Actually that blonde guy I went to school with when I was young so I already knew him but haven’t seen him in years
30/06/2021, 07:47 - Théodore Bedos: I see why you were so horny last night now
30/06/2021, 07:48 - Gracou: Yes bc no one compares to you and I wish I could have been there with you
30/06/2021, 07:49 - Théodore Bedos: Ahaha thanks
30/06/2021, 07:49 - Gracou: I am going to go back to sleep for a bit babe
30/06/2021, 07:49 - Théodore Bedos: Just how come is there a hot tub where she works?
30/06/2021, 07:50 - Gracou: Literally just for fun
30/06/2021, 07:50 - Gracou: It’s just for staff to use after work
30/06/2021, 07:50 - Théodore Bedos: But is it a restaurant, an hotel, a spa?
30/06/2021, 07:50 - Gracou: Restaurant
30/06/2021, 07:52 - Théodore Bedos: Alright
30/06/2021, 07:52 - Théodore Bedos: Sleep well, sexy bomb
30/06/2021, 07:53 - Gracou: Have a good start to your day hot stuff
30/06/2021, 13:26 - Théodore Bedos: Did you had a good sleep?
30/06/2021, 13:33 - Gracou: A very short sleep
30/06/2021, 13:34 - Gracou: Not long after I stopped talking to u we went back to Hannah’s and then I only slept for like 40 mins
30/06/2021, 13:34 - Gracou: How was your sleep?
30/06/2021, 13:36 - Théodore Bedos: I slept very well
30/06/2021, 13:36 - Théodore Bedos: I was curious of how far hannah was living from your house so I looked on the map of Snapchat and it seems sooo far away!! How come do you know her that well if she lives that far?
30/06/2021, 13:37 - Gracou: Because we have been to school together since we were 5
30/06/2021, 13:37 - Gracou: She used to live even further away
30/06/2021, 13:37 - Théodore Bedos: But how come have you been in the same school if you live so far apart
30/06/2021, 13:37 - Gracou: It took me about an hour to get home today
30/06/2021, 13:38 - Gracou: Because lots of people travel from far away to go to my school
30/06/2021, 13:38 - Théodore Bedos: how long did you or her were taking every day to go to school?
30/06/2021, 13:39 - Gracou: I always had friends very far from me it made me not hang out with them outside school very often bc my mum didn’t want to drive 2hrs so I could see my friend and then pick me up again later which would take another 2 hours haha
30/06/2021, 13:39 - Gracou: She says it took her like 30mins there is an exit of the motorway nearby the school
30/06/2021, 13:41 - Théodore Bedos: And you?
30/06/2021, 13:41 - Gracou: Like 10mins lol
30/06/2021, 13:41 - Gracou: I used to drive home a bunch
30/06/2021, 13:42 - Théodore Bedos: How can you be 10min away, her 30 min away, and you two 1h apart
30/06/2021, 13:42 - Théodore Bedos: There is a math issue
30/06/2021, 13:42 - Gracou: This is why I think Hannah is bullshitting
30/06/2021, 13:42 - Gracou: But it could be bc of the motorway thing I’m not so close to it so have to go thru a bunch of lanes
30/06/2021, 13:43 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
30/06/2021, 13:43 - Gracou: This is what it says rn but it was 55 when I went yesterday and I was behind people who just couldn’t fricken drive today so it took ages
30/06/2021, 13:44 - Gracou: And I got stuck behind two different tractors
30/06/2021, 13:44 - Théodore Bedos: I see I see
30/06/2021, 13:44 - Théodore Bedos: 30min is fine
30/06/2021, 13:45 - Théodore Bedos: I had friends who where doing 45 min every day in the subway
30/06/2021, 13:45 - Gracou: Oh that was just from my house to her house not to school
30/06/2021, 13:45 - Théodore Bedos: Yes yes that why I said 30 min
30/06/2021, 13:45 - Théodore Bedos: Like what she said
30/06/2021, 13:45 - Gracou: Ahh
30/06/2021, 13:46 - Théodore Bedos: But at least the metro you can take it alone after 10 years old easily
30/06/2021, 13:46 - Gracou: Yeah
30/06/2021, 13:46 - Gracou: It’s just tough if u drive ur child somewhere and then have to drive all the way back again
30/06/2021, 13:47 - Gracou: I have slightly bad news
30/06/2021, 13:47 - Théodore Bedos: Go on
30/06/2021, 13:49 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
30/06/2021, 13:50 - Gracou: I’m gunna try again now
30/06/2021, 13:51 - Gracou: Did u say it was 48hrs for antigen and 72 for pcr?
30/06/2021, 13:52 - Théodore Bedos: Spain as always needed a test
30/06/2021, 13:53 - Théodore Bedos: If you are not vaccines
30/06/2021, 13:53 - Théodore Bedos: Veccines
30/06/2021, 13:53 - Gracou: No they didn’t I just had to sign something
30/06/2021, 13:53 - Théodore Bedos: Vaccinated
30/06/2021, 13:53 - Gracou: They have had it changed from the 1st of July onwards
30/06/2021, 13:54 - Théodore Bedos: Ok, then why don't you just ask Beth to stay in her room when you moves your stuff, you wear a mask, and it's ok
30/06/2021, 13:55 - Gracou: No I will be there for hours trying to sort stuff out and she obviously has touched everything
30/06/2021, 13:55 - Gracou: If I get covid then I can’t come at all
30/06/2021, 13:55 - Gracou: And I need to start working so I wouldn’t be able to just postpone the trip until august
30/06/2021, 13:55 - Gracou: I don’t want to screw up the one chance to see you
30/06/2021, 13:56 - Théodore Bedos: Ok ok, you can leave one day earlier, it's not a problem
30/06/2021, 13:57 - Gracou: Sorry I’m just worried I feel like things keep going wrong
30/06/2021, 13:58 - Théodore Bedos: Can you move your flights? Maybe you would like to arrive and leave earlier in Barcelona now that you don't need to be there after the 3rs
30/06/2021, 13:58 - Théodore Bedos: 3rd
30/06/2021, 13:58 - Théodore Bedos: No worries it's gonna be alright
30/06/2021, 13:59 - Théodore Bedos: And if it fucked, I would have been fully vaccinated the 6th of July and I will come
30/06/2021, 13:59 - Gracou: Yay that’s good
30/06/2021, 14:00 - Gracou: I probably could move my flights but I already have the pcr test booked so I would have to move everything
30/06/2021, 14:00 - Gracou: I’m not sure it’s worth it
30/06/2021, 14:00 - Gracou: And I might have to pay a fine
30/06/2021, 14:01 - Théodore Bedos: You have it booked in England or in Spain?
30/06/2021, 14:01 - Gracou: In England
30/06/2021, 14:02 - Théodore Bedos: You know that it doesn't have to be a PCR?
30/06/2021, 14:02 - Gracou: The Spanish one is all in Spanish and u have to speak to a call person in Spanish
30/06/2021, 14:02 - Théodore Bedos: Because the PCR is very exoensive
30/06/2021, 14:02 - Gracou: My mum already booked it
30/06/2021, 14:02 - Gracou: It was £90
30/06/2021, 14:02 - Gracou: Not too bad
30/06/2021, 14:02 - Théodore Bedos: Ok that is reasonable, but you could get an antigen for 50 in boots
30/06/2021, 14:03 - Théodore Bedos: Why don't you ask Disha to help you book one?
30/06/2021, 14:03 - Gracou: I’ve asked
30/06/2021, 14:03 - Gracou: Hopefully she replies soon
30/06/2021, 14:03 - Théodore Bedos: She probably knows where to get a cheap one
30/06/2021, 14:03 - Théodore Bedos: In France it is free for exampke
30/06/2021, 14:04 - Théodore Bedos: Ok she will no worries
30/06/2021, 14:04 - Gracou: The antigen one in Spain is only 40 euros
30/06/2021, 14:04 - Théodore Bedos: Ok nice
30/06/2021, 14:04 - Gracou: And I’m going to go get my first vaccine tomorrow too woo
30/06/2021, 14:04 - Théodore Bedos: Niceeeee
30/06/2021, 14:04 - Théodore Bedos: I was going to suggest you to do it
30/06/2021, 14:05 - Gracou: I thought u would haha
30/06/2021, 14:05 - Gracou: It’s why I mentioned it
30/06/2021, 14:10 - Théodore Bedos: It's gonna be ok don't worry
30/06/2021, 14:11 - Gracou: Thanks baby

30/06/2021, 14:21 - Théodore Bedos: My dinner outfit won't have anything special I think
30/06/2021, 14:21 - Théodore Bedos: It's chill
30/06/2021, 14:21 - Gracou: It will be on something special though
30/06/2021, 14:22 - Théodore Bedos: Yes but it wasn't my grandfather style to be very ceremonial
30/06/2021, 14:23 - Gracou: I was trying to imply that you were the something special x
30/06/2021, 14:23 - Théodore Bedos: Aha, ok you will get it

30/06/2021, 14:27 - Théodore Bedos: Except one in Normandy
30/06/2021, 14:28 - Gracou: Well I like children
30/06/2021, 14:29 - Théodore Bedos: Some are children, but some are just in that very annoying age in between 12 and 16
30/06/2021, 14:29 - Gracou: Oh
30/06/2021, 14:29 - Gracou: Yeah that’s unfortunate

30/06/2021, 21:22 - Gracou: Hahaha ur aunt is flirting with me😌
30/06/2021, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: It's familiar but very explicit, you say that to very pretty persons
30/06/2021, 21:23 - Gracou: It’s explicit?!
30/06/2021, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: About very pretty person
30/06/2021, 21:23 - Gracou: Explicit like a swear word?
30/06/2021, 21:24 - Théodore Bedos: By explicit, I mean that when you say it you don't mean anything else than gorgeous
30/06/2021, 21:25 - Gracou: Ohhhh
30/06/2021, 21:25 - Gracou: That’s very very sweet of them
30/06/2021, 21:29 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
30/06/2021, 21:29 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
30/06/2021, 21:58 - Gracou: Aww your mum looks pretty
30/06/2021, 21:59 - Gracou: U didn’t send me a picture of you!
30/06/2021, 21:59 - Gracou: Have u watched the most recent Loki?
30/06/2021, 22:55 - Théodore Bedos: No I haven't watched it yet, did you?
30/06/2021, 22:56 - Théodore Bedos: I will send you a picture
30/06/2021, 22:56 - Théodore Bedos: I left in a rush and I didn't have time
30/06/2021, 23:06 - Gracou: Yes I have so I won’t spoil it
30/06/2021, 23:06 - Théodore Bedos: Was it good?
30/06/2021, 23:07 - Gracou: I can’t discuss it with you yet
30/06/2021, 23:07 - Théodore Bedos: Ok
30/06/2021, 23:09 - Gracou: U will get it when u watch it
30/06/2021, 23:27 - Gracou: Babbbyyyy
30/06/2021, 23:38 - Théodore Bedos: What?
30/06/2021, 23:38 - Gracou: I wanted to see a pic of u!
30/06/2021, 23:46 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
30/06/2021, 23:46 - Théodore Bedos: I just did it
30/06/2021, 23:50 - Gracou: Aw babe did u get someone to take it for u
30/06/2021, 23:50 - Gracou: I thought u were at home
30/06/2021, 23:53 - Théodore Bedos: My dad when we came back
30/06/2021, 23:53 - Théodore Bedos: And my mom made fun of me for doing this
30/06/2021, 23:55 - Gracou: Hahaha
30/06/2021, 23:55 - Gracou: What did she say
30/06/2021, 23:55 - Gracou: Did u tell her I made u
30/06/2021, 23:56 - Théodore Bedos: Yes and I wonder if it is that, that made her laugh at me even more
30/06/2021, 23:57 - Gracou: What do u mean ‘I wonder if it is that’
30/06/2021, 23:58 - Théodore Bedos: I am wondering if it is because I said that I was doing it for you, that she laugh at me
30/06/2021, 23:58 - Gracou: Well yes it’s quite funny
30/06/2021, 23:58 - Gracou: And she probably wouldn’t expect it of u
30/06/2021, 23:58 - Gracou: I certainly didn’t expect you to ask ur dad to take the picture😂😂😂
30/06/2021, 23:58 - Théodore Bedos: And I am not sure I will do it again because my mom is making fun of me and I don't even get a compliment from you
30/06/2021, 23:59 - Gracou: Well I was thinking lots of compliments
30/06/2021, 23:59 - Gracou: But I find this quite hypocritical bc I often send u pictures and don’t receive compliments back
01/07/2021, 00:01 - Théodore Bedos: Are you joking? I always write how amazing you are when you send me a picture
01/07/2021, 00:01 - Théodore Bedos: I dare you to find even once where I didn't
01/07/2021, 00:01 - Gracou: I think there have been a few times where I have been grumpy bc you haven’t said much
01/07/2021, 00:01 - Gracou: On Snapchat certainly but it will delete
01/07/2021, 00:02 - Théodore Bedos: No way
01/07/2021, 00:02 - Gracou: I think that you look very handsome
01/07/2021, 00:02 - Gracou: And I see you finally got that type of top you really wanted
01/07/2021, 00:04 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you
01/07/2021, 00:05 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I received it today from vinted, but the bottom doesn't fit very well so I have to tuck it in my trouser
01/07/2021, 00:05 - Gracou: It still looks nice that way bc it has quite a wide fit and u wouldn’t want to lose ur waist line
01/07/2021, 00:07 - Théodore Bedos: Yes that's what I meant, it is too loose at the bottom. I would have liked it to be more adjusted
01/07/2021, 00:14 - Théodore Bedos: You've made a great first impression tonight
01/07/2021, 00:15 - Gracou: Yes I see
01/07/2021, 00:15 - Gracou: But u still look sexy in it
01/07/2021, 00:15 - Gracou: Really?!
01/07/2021, 00:16 - Théodore Bedos: Yes you impressed them all
01/07/2021, 00:16 - Gracou: 😁
01/07/2021, 00:16 - Gracou: Did they talk about me much?
01/07/2021, 00:16 - Gracou: What did you tell them about me?
01/07/2021, 00:17 - Théodore Bedos: They asked me what you were doing in bath, and if you were speaking French, and also we joked a lot about my grandmother trying to speak in English to you
01/07/2021, 00:18 - Gracou: That’s nice
01/07/2021, 00:18 - Gracou: What did u say about what I was doing in bath and my french
01/07/2021, 00:23 - Théodore Bedos: You were starting your 3rd year of business, and that you didn't speak french but that you were trying to learn
01/07/2021, 00:24 - Gracou: I’m glad they approved
01/07/2021, 00:28 - Théodore Bedos: Oh and first thing my grandmother said was that you had very beautiful eyes
01/07/2021, 00:33 - Gracou: :)
01/07/2021, 00:33 - Gracou: See babe brown isn’t so bad
01/07/2021, 00:41 - Théodore Bedos: I just finsihed Loki
01/07/2021, 00:42 - Théodore Bedos: I thought it was really good
01/07/2021, 00:42 - Gracou: Yes
01/07/2021, 00:42 - Gracou: They are deffo gunna bring back mobius and Loki tho
01/07/2021, 00:42 - Gracou: How could they not
01/07/2021, 00:43 - Gracou: I feel like perhaps they could have lost Loki bc the budget wasn’t enough and then just kept Sylvie but not w mobius to
01/07/2021, 00:43 - Gracou: Plus it’s literally a show called Loki
01/07/2021, 00:43 - Théodore Bedos: Have you seen the post generic scene?
01/07/2021, 00:45 - Gracou: No I have not
01/07/2021, 00:45 - Gracou: I used to check very time whether there was one but there was never one
01/07/2021, 00:45 - Théodore Bedos: There is always a teaser for the next episode
01/07/2021, 00:45 - Théodore Bedos: Loki isn't dead
01/07/2021, 00:45 - Gracou: Oh
01/07/2021, 00:46 - Gracou: Great
01/07/2021, 00:46 - Gracou: Didn’t think so
01/07/2021, 00:46 - Gracou: What happened in the scene
01/07/2021, 00:46 - Théodore Bedos: Don't you wanna look at it?
01/07/2021, 00:46 - Gracou: One thing I will say I don’t like about the show is how they make out that Loki is rlly close w mobius and Sylvie when he has spent barely any time with them
01/07/2021, 00:47 - Gracou: Like he honestly shows less emotion towards Thor
01/07/2021, 00:47 - Gracou: No tell me
01/07/2021, 00:48 - Théodore Bedos: He is waken up by a groop of 4 different version of Loki
01/07/2021, 00:48 - Théodore Bedos: An old loki in a 80's suite, a teenager loki, a lezard Loki and a black thor
01/07/2021, 00:50 - Gracou: Oh nice
01/07/2021, 00:50 - Gracou: Hahaha black Thor
01/07/2021, 00:50 - Gracou: I like that
01/07/2021, 00:50 - Gracou: I’m looking forward to it
01/07/2021, 00:51 - Gracou: We could watch it together!
01/07/2021, 01:08 - Théodore Bedos: I'd love to
01/07/2021, 01:09 - Gracou: I’m probably going to go to sleep now darling
01/07/2021, 01:09 - Gracou: You’re up so so late are you feeling okay?
01/07/2021, 01:10 - Théodore Bedos: I'm gonna go too
01/07/2021, 01:10 - Théodore Bedos: We came back late and then I wanted to watch that episode to talk about it with you
01/07/2021, 01:11 - Gracou: In that case Sorry I wasn’t replying so quickly
01/07/2021, 01:11 - Théodore Bedos: Make good dreams my love, can't wait to see you 😘
01/07/2021, 01:12 - Gracou: I can’t way to see you too❤️😘😘
01/07/2021, 01:12 - Gracou: I’ve been thinking of you lots today
01/07/2021, 01:12 - Théodore Bedos: Me too, you are always in my mind
01/07/2021, 01:13 - Gracou: 🥺😘
01/07/2021, 12:10 - Théodore Bedos: In case you cannot take the plane I have a friend who told me that you could easily take the bus to cross the frontiere
01/07/2021, 12:10 - Gracou: And I wouldn’t be stopped?
01/07/2021, 12:11 - Théodore Bedos: They would ask you for your test when you get into the bus but they wouldn't check your passport
01/07/2021, 12:11 - Gracou: Okay cool that’s good
01/07/2021, 12:11 - Théodore Bedos: And then you wouldn't be stopped at the frontier
01/07/2021, 12:12 - Gracou: They wouldn’t check my
Passport tho?
01/07/2021, 12:12 - Théodore Bedos: No
01/07/2021, 12:13 - Gracou: Okay good that’s plan b then
01/07/2021, 12:13 - Gracou: Plan c is I enter in your trunk
01/07/2021, 12:13 - Théodore Bedos: They don't ask the passports of a full bus
01/07/2021, 12:19 - Gracou: Okay :)
01/07/2021, 12:22 - Théodore Bedos: Do you still want to try the flight first or would you take the bus and then a train instead?
01/07/2021, 12:22 - Gracou: Yes I already have the ticket so surely I may as well
01/07/2021, 12:23 - Théodore Bedos: Ok let's hope that they won't fine you if there is a problem
01/07/2021, 12:31 - Gracou: Do u think I should try the bus first?
01/07/2021, 12:40 - Théodore Bedos: Yes and no, if you could cancel the flight you already got, maybe
01/07/2021, 12:40 - Gracou: Hmm
01/07/2021, 12:40 - Gracou: How long will it take me to get there by bus?
01/07/2021, 12:41 - Théodore Bedos: It would be long, it would take 5 hours up to Toulouse and 4/5h from Toulouse to Paris by train
01/07/2021, 12:41 - Théodore Bedos: So it would be long
01/07/2021, 12:42 - Théodore Bedos: I could meet you in Toulouse to make half of the way with you
01/07/2021, 12:42 - Théodore Bedos: But maybe it's not needed to do all of that
01/07/2021, 12:42 - Gracou: Ah darling but then you would have to have a long trip too
01/07/2021, 12:42 - Gracou: Do u think it’s likely I will be denied at the frontier?
01/07/2021, 12:44 - Théodore Bedos: I don't mind if it's for you
01/07/2021, 12:45 - Théodore Bedos: What am I worried is if you are not controlled in Barcelona but if you are controlled in the airport in Paris and then you are stuck here or be sent back or whatever
01/07/2021, 12:46 - Gracou: If they don’t let me into Paris then I will go back to Barcelona I suppose
01/07/2021, 12:46 - Gracou: And then try the bus
01/07/2021, 12:47 - Gracou: I will think about it tho bc it might be better to do the bus first
01/07/2021, 12:52 - Théodore Bedos: I think it should be fine, there shouldn't be a control between European countries
01/07/2021, 12:53 - Théodore Bedos: We might be over thinking it, it should be fine
01/07/2021, 12:54 - Théodore Bedos: They shouldn't even look at your passport, just your ID between Spain and France is enough to prouve that you own your tickets
01/07/2021, 12:54 - Gracou: Really?!
01/07/2021, 12:55 - Théodore Bedos: It should be like when I use to take the train between France and Germany, they just asked my tickets and my ID to prove that it was my tickets
01/07/2021, 12:55 - Théodore Bedos: No worries, it will be fine
01/07/2021, 12:56 - Gracou: Yes but they could be stricter bc of covid
01/07/2021, 12:56 - Gracou: I hope you’re right
01/07/2021, 14:46 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
01/07/2021, 14:53 - Théodore Bedos: Of course you can see a doctor in France you just won't be paid back as I would be
01/07/2021, 14:54 - Théodore Bedos: So if you don't take this medicament you will always be on periods? How is that possible?
01/07/2021, 15:18 - Gracou: Bc of the implant in my arm it has messed up my hormones
01/07/2021, 15:18 - Gracou: She thought it would be fixed by now but it’s come back
01/07/2021, 15:18 - Gracou: I’m
Just getting my vaccine now so I can explain later :)
01/07/2021, 15:19 - Théodore Bedos: good luck
01/07/2021, 15:19 - Gracou: Thanks babe
01/07/2021, 15:28 - Gracou: I was so brave
01/07/2021, 15:29 - Gracou: Do u want me to explain the period thing or do u feel like you know enough
01/07/2021, 15:30 - Théodore Bedos: Explain me please
01/07/2021, 15:31 - Théodore Bedos: Which vaccine did you get?
01/07/2021, 15:31 - Gracou: Okay so it isn’t anything to worry about I’ve had my hormones tested and when it first happened I did an STI test so there is nothing like that that u need to worry about
01/07/2021, 15:31 - Gracou: Pfizer
01/07/2021, 15:32 - Gracou: But basically the implant in my arm
When I first got it made me have a period straight for around three months
01/07/2021, 15:32 - Gracou: Then I didn’t have one for like 6 or 7 months maybe
01/07/2021, 15:32 - Gracou: And then In May maybe of last year I started getting them just a bunch and it got progressively worse
01/07/2021, 15:33 - Gracou: Like it started that I would have it every two weeks instead of 4 but eventually it became that I would spend 3 weeks bleeding and have 3 days not bleeding
01/07/2021, 15:33 - Gracou: Obviously rlly annoying
01/07/2021, 15:34 - Gracou: So my doctor prescribed me the pill to regulate my hormones and I had to take it straight for 3 months
01/07/2021, 15:34 - Gracou: And even after like my first week of taking it it was basically fixed
01/07/2021, 15:34 - Gracou: And it hasn’t come back until now
01/07/2021, 15:35 - Gracou: So she will probably just give me the same pills that she did before
01/07/2021, 15:35 - Gracou: It’s just the progesterone only birth control pill bc I can’t take the normal one bc of my migraines
01/07/2021, 15:42 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you say that it hasn't come back until now, when we were together in bath you told me multiple times that you were on you periods
01/07/2021, 15:42 - Gracou: Yes but they were normal periods that were normally spaced
01/07/2021, 15:42 - Gracou: It hasn’t come back until now where I’m having more than I should
01/07/2021, 15:43 - Théodore Bedos: Mm ok, and now it's all the time
01/07/2021, 15:43 - Gracou: Yeah
01/07/2021, 15:44 - Théodore Bedos: Is it normal that your arm thing makes you have period all the time!
01/07/2021, 15:44 - Théodore Bedos: ?
01/07/2021, 15:44 - Théodore Bedos: Does other persons have that too?
01/07/2021, 15:44 - Gracou: Yes my doctor said that it can happen
01/07/2021, 15:44 - Gracou: But she thought it would be fixed after the first time so I will see what happens tomorrow
01/07/2021, 15:44 - Gracou: My arm aches
01/07/2021, 15:45 - Théodore Bedos: Ok and so why cannot you receive your pills in time?
01/07/2021, 15:45 - Gracou: Lots of girls get rlly horrible problems with their periods when they have the implant
01/07/2021, 15:46 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
01/07/2021, 15:49 - Théodore Bedos: Alright I see, let me know quickly tomorrow because I am gonna need to book an appointment for you and the delay will be short
01/07/2021, 15:49 - Gracou: The delay will be short?
01/07/2021, 15:49 - Gracou: Oh so that I can have an appointment soon after I get there
01/07/2021, 15:49 - Gracou: Thank you sweetheart
01/07/2021, 15:50 - Théodore Bedos: There will be a short time between when you tell me and when you'll be here, and I am not sure that I can have an appointment with the right doctor in just a week
01/07/2021, 15:50 - Gracou: Okay thank you baby good thinking
01/07/2021, 15:51 - Théodore Bedos: No problem
01/07/2021, 15:51 - Théodore Bedos: I did Pfizer too, how do you feel?
01/07/2021, 15:51 - Gracou: The receptionist will think ur very adorable booking an appointment for your girlfriend
01/07/2021, 15:51 - Gracou: My arm aches and I feel dizzy
01/07/2021, 15:51 - Théodore Bedos: The 1st one did nothing to me
01/07/2021, 15:51 - Gracou: Did u feel the second one?
01/07/2021, 15:52 - Théodore Bedos: I do it on the 6th so not yet, but my cousin and my mom who did Pfizer felt nothing on the first one and felt quiet bad 1/2 days after the 2nd one
01/07/2021, 15:52 - Gracou: Ohhh
01/07/2021, 15:53 - Gracou: Interesting
01/07/2021, 15:53 - Théodore Bedos: 1 or 2 days not half a day

01/07/2021, 23:36 - Gracou: Hi darling

02/07/2021, 13:12 - Théodore Bedos: In Paris some walking so you should have a pair of sneakers. In normandy some swimming, going a the beach, maybe playing tennis, (I would gym a bit the garden), so swim wear and sports wear. And in the south there is the swimming pool, there is wake board zone and that thing where you climb from tree to tree, so also swim wear and sports wear
02/07/2021, 13:13 - Théodore Bedos: We have many towels and everything for the beach so don't worry about that
02/07/2021, 13:40 - Gracou: Should I bring a wet suit?
02/07/2021, 13:48 - Théodore Bedos: Absolutely not
02/07/2021, 15:54 - Gracou: No need to call me back or anything I was just going to tell u that my doctor is sending the pills I wanted so hopefully it could come in time
02/07/2021, 15:26 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
02/07/2021, 16:02 - Théodore Bedos: I was with my physio sorry
02/07/2021, 16:06 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
02/07/2021, 16:07 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
02/07/2021, 16:07 - Théodore Bedos: Because I know that you really like pepperoni pizzas
02/07/2021, 16:08 - Gracou: Oooo sexy
02/07/2021, 16:08 - Gracou: Does your skin really rise in those things that much?
02/07/2021, 16:08 - Théodore Bedos: Rise??
02/07/2021, 16:09 - Théodore Bedos: What do you mean?
02/07/2021, 16:09 - Gracou: Yes like it rises up in the suction cup
02/07/2021, 16:09 - Gracou: Also I just got tested :)
02/07/2021, 16:09 - Théodore Bedos: Yes like a good 2cm
02/07/2021, 16:09 - Théodore Bedos: And it's quiet painfull
02/07/2021, 16:10 - Théodore Bedos: Desagreable more than painful
02/07/2021, 16:10 - Théodore Bedos: Oh so you got the PCR? Did they said if you'll get it in time
02/07/2021, 16:10 - Gracou: Does it hurt to touch now?
02/07/2021, 16:11 - Théodore Bedos: No it doesn't
02/07/2021, 16:11 - Théodore Bedos: But I can't touch directly, I only do it through my t-shirt, it discust me a lot
02/07/2021, 16:11 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
02/07/2021, 16:11 - Gracou: Why does it disgust u
02/07/2021, 16:12 - Gracou: Surely it’s just a bruise
02/07/2021, 16:12 - Gracou: Will you have them when I come?
02/07/2021, 16:13 - Théodore Bedos: It should just be gone when you arrive
02/07/2021, 16:14 - Théodore Bedos: I really hate blood take, and needles and every thing like that, I couldn't watch my skin while they were being sucked
02/07/2021, 16:14 - Théodore Bedos: I did at the beginning but Hen it start turning purple I just couldnmt5
02/07/2021, 16:14 - Théodore Bedos: Couldn't
02/07/2021, 16:15 - Théodore Bedos: *but when it start turning ourple
02/07/2021, 16:15 - Théodore Bedos: Purple
02/07/2021, 16:16 - Théodore Bedos: For your pills, are you sure that you'll have them in time or is there a chance that not
02/07/2021, 17:02 - Gracou: Ah i would have been interested to see what they are like in person
02/07/2021, 17:03 - Gracou: But they aren’t having blood taken or anything surely
02/07/2021, 17:03 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
02/07/2021, 17:04 - Gracou: I went to the pharmacy to tell them i was leaving the country and see if there was anything they could do
02/07/2021, 17:04 - Gracou: And the guy was rlly nice and just prepared it for me straight away
02/07/2021, 17:05 - Théodore Bedos: So you have it all now? Nice!
02/07/2021, 17:05 - Gracou: Yeah they gave me 3 months worth!
02/07/2021, 17:06 - Gracou: I’m super happy they were able to help me
02/07/2021, 17:06 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
02/07/2021, 17:07 - Gracou: I could have just not told u about my uterus being grumpy haha
02/07/2021, 17:07 - Théodore Bedos: Babe, is it because this thing that you had no sex drive at the beginning when we met. You know you told me that you had no sex drive because of something and then you where getting it back thanks to me after
02/07/2021, 17:07 - Gracou: My doctor suggested that in September she is going to take the implant out (earlier than she normally would) and I think I will get an IUD instead
02/07/2021, 17:07 - Gracou: Yes sorry
02/07/2021, 17:08 - Gracou: It might mess with my sex drive a little
02/07/2021, 17:08 - Gracou: But I find u so irresistible it surely couldn’t do that much
02/07/2021, 17:08 - Gracou: But also I think the problem came once I stopped taking the pills so we should be fine for July
02/07/2021, 17:09 - Gracou: Starting them probs won’t break it
02/07/2021, 17:09 - Théodore Bedos: Alright I see
02/07/2021, 17:09 - Gracou: R u worried?
02/07/2021, 17:09 - Théodore Bedos: What is an IUD?
02/07/2021, 17:09 - Gracou: They put a device in ur uterus
02/07/2021, 17:10 - Théodore Bedos: No not so very but I want to understand
02/07/2021, 17:10 - Gracou: I am not a big fan of them honestly but they seem like my best option
02/07/2021, 17:10 - Théodore Bedos: Why don't you keep the implant?
02/07/2021, 17:10 - Gracou: I can’t really take the normal pill, the implant isn’t agreeing with me and plus if I get it for many years I will end up with multiple scars on my arm
02/07/2021, 17:11 - Gracou: Yes I will get rid of the implant I think
02/07/2021, 17:11 - Gracou: But the thing I rlly don’t like about IUD is that sometimes u could maybe feel it
02/07/2021, 17:11 - Gracou: I will ask joe if he feels dishas
02/07/2021, 17:14 - Gracou: What are your thoughts?
02/07/2021, 17:15 - Théodore Bedos: I don't have one, except that what's best for you is the best for me
02/07/2021, 17:15 - Gracou: Aw
02/07/2021, 17:15 - Gracou: Hopefully joe says u can’t feel it
02/07/2021, 17:16 - Gracou: But I’m not 100% decided my doctor asked me to call her back to speak about it
02/07/2021, 17:16 - Théodore Bedos: If she propose it to you it should be that it is fine
02/07/2021, 17:16 - Gracou: My doctor?
02/07/2021, 17:17 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
02/07/2021, 17:17 - Gracou: Yes it is safe and fine but when I’ve read about it it says that u can feel it
02/07/2021, 17:17 - Gracou: I don’t rlly want u to have to feel a piece of plastic in me
02/07/2021, 17:17 - Gracou: Not that u can feel it but just that sometimes u might
02/07/2021, 17:18 - Gracou: I think it might just be if u deeply fingered me tho and if that’s the case I’m not that bothered
02/07/2021, 17:18 - Gracou: But if ur penis can feel it then I’m not such a fan
02/07/2021, 17:18 - Théodore Bedos: My penis is longer than my fingers
02/07/2021, 17:18 - Gracou: This is just apparently what I’ve read
02/07/2021, 17:19 - Gracou: Plus u might completely reject my vagina ur not even a fan of touching my implant hahaha
02/07/2021, 17:22 - Théodore Bedos: I will never reject your vagina babe
02/07/2021, 17:22 - Théodore Bedos: Don't worry
02/07/2021, 17:34 - Gracou: This is a funny sentence
02/07/2021, 18:42 - Théodore Bedos: It is
02/07/2021, 18:42 - Théodore Bedos: It's also a funny thing to be worried about
02/07/2021, 18:57 - Gracou: Well I mean if I had an unlikeable vagina u probs wouldnt want me anymore
02/07/2021, 18:57 - Gracou: A major part of its utility is in its enjoyable-ness
02/07/2021, 19:16 - Théodore Bedos: I love you babe, not just your vagina
02/07/2021, 19:17 - Gracou: I feel like it plays a role tho
02/07/2021, 19:17 - Gracou: I would be disappointed if u had a plastic attachment on ur penis
02/07/2021, 19:18 - Théodore Bedos: Alright so I'll cancel my appointment for the penis plastic extension that I asked
02/07/2021, 19:19 - Gracou: Thank you I appreciate it
02/07/2021, 19:19 - Gracou: U haven’t watched Rick and morty have u?
02/07/2021, 19:20 - Théodore Bedos: No I haven't
02/07/2021, 20:48 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
02/07/2021, 20:48 - Gracou: Babe is this the skinny non musclular physique that is preferred amongst the french?
02/07/2021, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: Hell no
02/07/2021, 20:51 - Gracou: https://youtu.be/9prFyWXaRg4
02/07/2021, 20:52 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
02/07/2021, 20:52 - Gracou: This is the penis he picks it up bc he thinks it’s a gun
02/07/2021, 20:52 - Gracou: Phew
02/07/2021, 20:53 - Gracou: It reminded me of ur prosthetic penis joke
02/07/2021, 21:10 - Théodore Bedos: It's very funny
02/07/2021, 21:10 - Gracou: It’s a very funny show

03/07/2021, 13:14 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
03/07/2021, 13:14 - Théodore Bedos: Lunching with my grandmother and her beer
03/07/2021, 13:14 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
03/07/2021, 13:15 - Théodore Bedos: She is laughing, not crying

03/07/2021, 14:05 - Gracou: So
My parents are telling me if I get denied in soain to come to France then I have to go home, I can’t try the coach
03/07/2021, 14:18 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
03/07/2021, 14:58 - Gracou: Because they are controlling
03/07/2021, 14:59 - Gracou: And they have said that if I get denied at the boarder by the bus then they will just kick me off the bus and I will be stuck there with no way to leave
03/07/2021, 15:33 - Théodore Bedos: Except that they would never check a bus at the frontiere, they check you , when going in the bus
03/07/2021, 15:34 - Théodore Bedos: They would never ask each of the bus passenger their passport, bad their test, and then check for all of them where they were  week ago
03/07/2021, 15:34 - Théodore Bedos: And Alex took it last week and he told me that no one asked anything
03/07/2021, 15:56 - Gracou: They still said no
03/07/2021, 16:09 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you tell your parents for this kind of things?
03/07/2021, 16:09 - Gracou: They ask me
03/07/2021, 16:10 - Gracou: My father asked me what my plan was if I wasn’t allowed to fly
03/07/2021, 16:48 - Gracou: Do I have to print out a certificate of honour?
03/07/2021, 17:11 - Théodore Bedos: Last time I checked I didn't see that you needed one
03/07/2021, 17:12 - Théodore Bedos: But babe, at the instant you got denied, I jump in the first plane to Barcelona and we go together if you want, but I won't let you come back to England without trying something else
03/07/2021, 17:18 - Gracou: Okay it’s just my father is very strict and if I disobey him he will make my life very difficult
03/07/2021, 17:24 - Théodore Bedos: I know
03/07/2021, 17:25 - Gracou: I hope we don’t have to worry about it and I get through first time
03/07/2021, 17:25 - Théodore Bedos: It will be fine
03/07/2021, 17:58 - Théodore Bedos: I'm going to the cinema 3ith my friend in 5 min, and then if I'm out I won't be able to message because I have a problem with my internet

03/07/2021, 22:10 - Gracou: I can’t bring your converses darling
03/07/2021, 22:11 - Gracou: They are in bath and I couldn’t go to get them bc of Beth having to isolate
03/07/2021, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: Wait what? Why didn't you bring them with you when you took all your stuff back to denbury with your mom?
03/07/2021, 22:17 - Gracou: Because I thought I was going back to bath babe
03/07/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
03/07/2021, 22:18 - Gracou: Didn’t mean to call
03/07/2021, 23:34 - Gracou: Are u annoyed?
04/07/2021, 01:38 - Théodore Bedos: A bit but not really against you
04/07/2021, 07:38 - Gracou: Darling why were you awake
04/07/2021, 07:59 - Théodore Bedos: Because I am alone in my house with the 3 cats and they woke me up several times last night
04/07/2021, 08:00 - Théodore Bedos: And this morning, I woke up because I heard one of them weeing on my caps
04/07/2021, 08:04 - Théodore Bedos: And you what are you doing awake so early?
04/07/2021, 08:11 - Gracou: I have had a bit of a horrible night struggling to fall asleep bc of the flight and then when I feel asleep having nightmares over and over until I finally gave my self I migraine :/
04/07/2021, 08:11 - Gracou: And then I had to wake up at 7;30 in order to travel to Birmingham
04/07/2021, 08:27 - Théodore Bedos: I'm sorry for you, when is your flight?
04/07/2021, 08:53 - Théodore Bedos: Oh at 2 , I forgot, you told me before
04/07/2021, 09:01 - Gracou: Well remembered baby
04/07/2021, 09:01 - Gracou: Did they actually wee on ur caps,
04/07/2021, 09:10 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, he did
04/07/2021, 09:11 - Théodore Bedos: When do you have to leave your house?
04/07/2021, 09:12 - Gracou: We are currently in the car :)
04/07/2021, 09:12 - Gracou: This is quite funny
04/07/2021, 09:12 - Gracou: He is just like ur mum
04/07/2021, 09:23 - Gracou: Also guess how heavy my bag was this morning

04/07/2021, 09:35 - Gracou: To Birmingham
04/07/2021, 09:35 - Théodore Bedos: Babe honestly that's ridiculous
04/07/2021, 09:35 - Gracou: I’m going for a whole month
04/07/2021, 09:35 - Théodore Bedos: The limit was 25 kg in the plane
04/07/2021, 09:35 - Gracou: Darcy took 13kg for one week
04/07/2021, 09:35 - Gracou: I have taken stuff out
04/07/2021, 09:36 - Théodore Bedos: There shouldn't be a difference between a month and a week when there is a washing machine available 🤣
04/07/2021, 09:36 - Théodore Bedos: Why aren't you taking the train, surely that's a long way back for your parents?
04/07/2021, 09:36 - Gracou: Incorrect
04/07/2021, 09:37 - Gracou: There is no train today
04/07/2021, 09:37 - Théodore Bedos: How is that possible? I thought it was a big city
04/07/2021, 09:38 - Gracou: It’s a Sunday and ur not rlly supposed to be going to the airport so none of the trains that run near it are going today
04/07/2021, 09:40 - Théodore Bedos: Wow ok

04/07/2021, 13:19 - Théodore Bedos: Wow ok, I'm crossing my finger for you
04/07/2021, 13:19 - Théodore Bedos: So you say that there is the possibility to do an antigen test at the airport?
04/07/2021, 13:21 - Gracou: I’ve done the test it’s just they might not return my result in enough time
04/07/2021, 13:26 - Théodore Bedos: How long did they said it would take?
04/07/2021, 13:26 - Théodore Bedos: Is it not the 15 min results thing?
04/07/2021, 13:37 - Gracou: No 30 and they are busy
04/07/2021, 13:38 - Théodore Bedos: I guess you weren't allowed to register your luggage too
04/07/2021, 13:38 - Théodore Bedos: So you'll have to do that in a rush also,no?
04/07/2021, 13:52 - Gracou: I made it through thank goodness

04/07/2021, 13:53 - Gracou: I’ve been running up and down this big airport
04/07/2021, 13:53 - Théodore Bedos: So once you received the results, did you had to do the check in of your luggage or was it already done?
04/07/2021, 13:54 - Théodore Bedos: Because I thought that this would close an 1h befire the flight
04/07/2021, 13:58 - Gracou: Omg it started saying last call for my boarding area and I had to fricking run again
04/07/2021, 13:59 - Gracou: The lady was really kind she tagged my bag so al they had to do was press the button when I got my result
04/07/2021, 14:07 - Théodore Bedos: I wish you a good flight babe, text me when you are in your seat and when you arrive

05/07/2021, 22:03 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
05/07/2021, 22:03 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
05/07/2021, 22:03 - Gracou: What’s ur opinion on this dress
05/07/2021, 22:08 - Théodore Bedos: It's hard because every thing you were looks pretty
05/07/2021, 22:08 - Gracou: Yeah I’m not sure about it
05/07/2021, 22:08 - Théodore Bedos: I would say that I like it, but I would need to see the material because it looks a bit like a sleeping dress if it is too silky
05/07/2021, 22:09 - Gracou: It is silky
05/07/2021, 22:09 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
05/07/2021, 22:09 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it does look like you are going to sleep with it a bit
05/07/2021, 22:10 - Gracou: Hmm
05/07/2021, 22:10 - Théodore Bedos: from the front, the back looks nice
05/07/2021, 22:10 - Gracou: Thank you for your opinion
05/07/2021, 22:10 - Gracou: I’m trying to decide whether to return it
05/07/2021, 22:14 - Théodore Bedos: what does disha say
05/07/2021, 22:16 - Gracou: Disha likes it but she thinks there are aspects that are not as flattering as they could be but she thinks in general that it’s rlly good
05/07/2021, 22:16 - Gracou: Cute*
05/07/2021, 22:22 - Gracou: How was your time with your godmother❤️
05/07/2021, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: It was great, the restaurant was really really good
05/07/2021, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: And then we did a very long walk through Paris to come back
05/07/2021, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
05/07/2021, 22:47 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
05/07/2021, 23:04 - Gracou: Ah u didn’t say ur cousin was going
05/07/2021, 23:05 - Gracou: Speaking of walks through Paris have u planned what we will do together :)
05/07/2021, 23:05 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I did planned most of it
05/07/2021, 23:06 - Gracou: Ooooooi
05/07/2021, 23:12 - Gracou: That was meant to be ooooooo not oi
05/07/2021, 23:12 - Gracou: Do u have a revolut card or something like that?
05/07/2021, 23:13 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know what it is
05/07/2021, 23:13 - Gracou: Where it doesn’t charge u to take out foreign money and exchange it?
05/07/2021, 23:14 - Gracou: So I can send u pounds and it can come out of the atm as euros
05/07/2021, 23:14 - Gracou: Online banking card like monzo
05/07/2021, 23:15 - Théodore Bedos: No I don't have that
05/07/2021, 23:16 - Théodore Bedos: I don't think it charges that much to use your card directly, when I do in the UK with my french card, it takes me less than a pound by transaction
05/07/2021, 23:17 - Gracou: On Monday 14 the good body clini. Sent me £24 btw
05/07/2021, 23:17 - Gracou: Is that the right amount?
05/07/2021, 23:18 - Gracou: Yeah I still wouldn’t want to do it if I could avoid it :) I’ve been sending money to Disha and she has been taking it out for me
05/07/2021, 23:18 - Théodore Bedos: Yes apparently they did a partial refund, because of the cancellation
05/07/2021, 23:19 - Théodore Bedos: But I'm gonna tell them that it is not what the guy told us
05/07/2021, 23:19 - Gracou: Which cancellation?
05/07/2021, 23:19 - Gracou: No the guy said he would cancel it with no fee
05/07/2021, 23:19 - Théodore Bedos: I know, I'm gonna tell them
05/07/2021, 23:19 - Théodore Bedos: But the girl I had on the phone told me that their would be fees
05/07/2021, 23:20 - Gracou: Call when I’m with you maybe
05/07/2021, 23:22 - Théodore Bedos: Does that means that you think that she didn't understand me because of my English? Because if you do I would take it quiet bad. I clearly told her that and she said that she will discuss it.

Anyway can you send me back the refunds, I am actually near 0 on my English account and that's why my English number is currently not working, I sent money from France bit it takes ages to arrive when UK to UK is instant
05/07/2021, 23:24 - Théodore Bedos: I don't understand much how this would work and I don't have such an account, but we can do it together if you wnat
05/07/2021, 23:26 - Gracou: No darling not about your English it’s just I think I can be quite good at getting a refund for that sort of thing
05/07/2021, 23:27 - Gracou: But I’m sure ur completely capable of doing it yourself :)
05/07/2021, 23:27 - Gracou: Okay darling I can send the money
05/07/2021, 23:30 - Gracou: I don’t have your account details /)

07/07/2021, 09:26 - Théodore Bedos: Wow ok
07/07/2021, 09:26 - Gracou: A communication error that I didn’t think through
07/07/2021, 09:27 - Gracou: I told disha I wanted to be there two hours early in case there were problems so I wanted to be here at 12
07/07/2021, 09:27 - Gracou: And she took 2 hours off of that😂😂😂👌🏼

07/07/2021, 09:28 - Gracou: And I’m alone :(
07/07/2021, 09:29 - Gracou: One other time I had to wait 5 hours at the airport and it was torture but at least I was with other people
07/07/2021, 09:29 - Théodore Bedos: Do you have a book in your 30kg bag?

07/07/2021, 09:39 - Gracou: The other one is one of the psychological thrillers that Anna gave me for my birthday

07/07/2021, 12:14 - Théodore Bedos: it depends of the shops and the article but between 30% and 50%
07/07/2021, 12:15 - Gracou: In London when I had nothing to do on the weekends and no one to see I would just travel 1 hour and go by myself to all the shops on Oxford street
07/07/2021, 12:15 - Gracou: Not bad
07/07/2021, 12:16 - Théodore Bedos: That's quiet an expensive habit
07/07/2021, 12:16 - Gracou: If I was a housewife I would be such a financial burden bc of this habit😂 bc I would have nothing else’s to do
07/07/2021, 12:16 - Gracou: See this is why I told u to say no!

07/07/2021, 12:16 - Gracou: Piss off
07/07/2021, 12:17 - Théodore Bedos: When you have bought everything and nothing is left, their is only dots to satisfy you

Theo: ‘nice’
01/08/2021, 12:46 - Théodore Bedos: I was going to continue, bit my dad asked me to help him
01/08/2021, 12:46 - Gracou: Ohhh fair enough
01/08/2021, 12:46 - Théodore Bedos: I can't wait to be with you too
01/08/2021, 12:46 - Gracou: Nice
01/08/2021, 15:42 - Théodore Bedos: Are you well arrived
01/08/2021, 15:49 - Gracou: Omg what an annoying journey
01/08/2021, 15:50 - Gracou: Got to saint pancreas and found out they have cancelled all trains, tubes and buses to Waterloo bc of a marathon so had to choose between crawling around the underground with my bag for 40mins or take my chances with a bus. Got on the first bus that took me south of the river then dragged my bag for 20mins until I got to Waterloo
01/08/2021, 15:51 - Gracou: Missed my original train but just made it onto another one
01/08/2021, 15:56 - Théodore Bedos: Wowww
01/08/2021, 15:56 - Théodore Bedos: Is your dad still able to grab you
01/08/2021, 15:56 - Gracou: Yes I called and they will wait for me
01/08/2021, 15:57 - Gracou: Imagine closing a whole tube line and bus route for a marathon
01/08/2021, 16:00 - Théodore Bedos: Tubline, that's weird
01/08/2021, 16:00 - Gracou: The word tube line is weird?
01/08/2021, 16:00 - Théodore Bedos: Noooo
01/08/2021, 16:00 - Théodore Bedos: Closing a tubline
01/08/2021, 16:00 - Gracou: Sooooo weird
01/08/2021, 16:01 - Gracou: Doesn’t even let u get on it for 2 stops or something
01/08/2021, 16:01 - Gracou: Oh my gosh sitting near some of the most Scottish people I’ve ever heard
01/08/2021, 16:01 - Gracou: It’s a form of ASMR honestly
01/08/2021, 16:05 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
01/08/2021, 16:06 - Gracou: My room next year
01/08/2021, 16:36 - Théodore Bedos: Scottish is a form of ASMR??
01/08/2021, 16:36 - Théodore Bedos: Your room seems very nice
01/08/2021, 16:44 - Gracou: Honestly it sounds so nice in the ears that it should be an asmr genre
01/08/2021, 16:44 - Gracou: Thanks but there is nowhere to hang clothes
01/08/2021, 17:07 - Théodore Bedos: We can probably remove the planks in one of the shelves and attach a bar
01/08/2021, 17:08 - Théodore Bedos: I'll do it for you
01/08/2021, 17:15 - Gracou: Thank you baby❤️ that’s what I was thinking of doing too
01/08/2021, 19:58 - Théodore Bedos: Are you arrived?
01/08/2021, 20:19 - Gracou: No :( 9hrs of travel and still not home
01/08/2021, 20:21 - Gracou: Also babe, my dad is considering for one of my mums birthday presents to go somewhere in Thailand. He’s thinking somewhere romantic, with good food and maybe one of those huts on the sea and I said you or ur parents might know of somewhere?
01/08/2021, 20:37 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
01/08/2021, 20:38 - Théodore Bedos: Koh phi phi at the phi phi Island village
01/08/2021, 20:44 - Théodore Bedos: We like to always spend 2-3 days in Bangkok before going to an island to do shopping, go to the restaurant of very big hotel or other things. The Hilton millennium hotel is very nice
01/08/2021, 22:13 - Gracou: Thank you❤️
01/08/2021, 22:40 - Gracou: I hope you’re sleeping well xx

01/08/2021, 23:52 - Théodore Bedos: I really miss you
02/08/2021, 00:03 - Gracou: I am going to message the person who makes the Rotas and stuff at work about whether u can have a job at the hotel tomorrow - the owner said she wasn’t sure she had many jobs anymore bc they have already hired so many people, my Nan does 2 shifts a week and confirmed to me that they have a lot of staff and didn’t even need her last week so she didn’t do any shifts
02/08/2021, 00:04 - Gracou: I’m really hoping that they say they have work for both of us! I will let you know baby
02/08/2021, 00:21 - Théodore Bedos: What is a rotas? Is your gran mother working at that hotel aswell??
02/08/2021, 00:22 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks baby, I hope it will work
02/08/2021, 00:28 - Gracou: Yes she was bored so decided to do 2 mornings in the restaurant
02/08/2021, 00:28 - Gracou: Per week
02/08/2021, 00:28 - Gracou: Me too I really do❤️
02/08/2021, 00:28 - Gracou: A rota is the schedule of shifts
02/08/2021, 08:51 - Théodore Bedos: Good morning georgous!
02/08/2021, 08:52 - Théodore Bedos: How long has your grandmother been doing that? How old is she?
02/08/2021, 08:53 - Théodore Bedos: It sounds quiet dead then
02/08/2021, 10:19 - Gracou: Good morning gorgeous ❤️
02/08/2021, 10:19 - Gracou: Well when they really needed staff at the begining of summer she said she would do it - she is retired
02/08/2021, 10:20 - Gracou: Yes but of an issue
02/08/2021, 10:28 - Gracou: I woke up in the night thinking you were there and was so sad when I reached out and couldn’t cuddle u :( I kept waking up all night bc u weren’t there
02/08/2021, 10:32 - Théodore Bedos: I slept less good to
02/08/2021, 10:32 - Théodore Bedos: What does your grandmother do for them?
02/08/2021, 10:32 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know what that means
02/08/2021, 10:33 - Gracou: Bit of an issue
02/08/2021, 10:33 - Gracou: She does breakfasts in the restaurant 2 mornings a week
02/08/2021, 10:35 - Théodore Bedos: Oh I see, I should have understood
02/08/2021, 10:38 - Théodore Bedos: Last chance then is to ask your dad? Honestly it could be fun if he is ok.
02/08/2021, 10:40 - Gracou: Let me see what The hotel says and then we can try to work something else out
02/08/2021, 10:43 - Théodore Bedos: Sure sure
02/08/2021, 11:19 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
02/08/2021, 11:30 - Théodore Bedos: Is it a movie?
02/08/2021, 11:31 - Gracou: It’s like the most famous romantic movie
02/08/2021, 12:21 - Théodore Bedos: I'll watch it with you

02/08/2021, 12:28 - Théodore Bedos: I've cut a PVC piece from a painting tool and then fold it in the shape of the broken part to fix the bin
02/08/2021, 12:28 - Théodore Bedos: I really deserved a 1st in engineering
02/08/2021, 12:40 - Gracou: Babe u should have done this earlier and included the video as evidence in ur email
02/08/2021, 12:40 - Gracou: They would have definitely given u a first ifthey had seen this
02/08/2021, 12:41 - Théodore Bedos: I know I know
02/08/2021, 12:42 - Gracou: Dammit
02/08/2021, 12:44 - Théodore Bedos: That's been 1 or 2 years that the bin is broken, I am not livi g here all year so I thought that someone would be bored of it and buy a new one but apparently not
02/08/2021, 12:45 - Gracou: Haha
02/08/2021, 12:45 - Gracou: Is that what ur dad asked u to do?
02/08/2021, 12:45 - Théodore Bedos: No no, I got pissed by it and I decided to fix it
02/08/2021, 12:45 - Théodore Bedos: Honestly, I am quiet proud of it
02/08/2021, 12:56 - Gracou: I would be proud of it too
02/08/2021, 12:56 - Gracou: Especially bc u used random materials, u didn’t go and just buy something
02/08/2021, 12:57 - Théodore Bedos: Yes excatly
02/08/2021, 12:59 - Gracou: Do u have any other plans tofay?

02/08/2021, 13:24 - Gracou: So remember how we didn’t think ur cats pissed on my clothes
02/08/2021, 13:26 - Théodore Bedos: Omgggg
02/08/2021, 13:26 - Théodore Bedos: Your luggage must smell so bad
02/08/2021, 13:27 - Théodore Bedos: How did you not smell it when you packed ??
02/08/2021, 13:27 - Gracou: I actually have no clue
02/08/2021, 13:27 - Gracou: They peed right at the bottom of it
02/08/2021, 13:27 - Gracou: They must have dug down to reach it
02/08/2021, 13:27 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry babe
02/08/2021, 13:27 - Gracou: Most of my stuff doesn’t smell either very weird
02/08/2021, 13:28 - Gracou: Don’t worry babe we did our best

02/08/2021, 13:56 - Théodore Bedos: Well done manga

02/08/2021, 14:27 - Gracou: No I’m very sad about it :(
02/08/2021, 14:28 - Gracou: The other thing is, we could look at jobs in bath since I’m already paying rent there
02/08/2021, 14:28 - Gracou: Washing all of the clothes in my 30kg suitcase
02/08/2021, 14:32 - Théodore Bedos: Yes definitely, by I'm not so sure of were to look
02/08/2021, 14:40 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
02/08/2021, 14:40 - Gracou: Awww she looks like she is hugging herself
02/08/2021, 14:40 - Gracou: Me either
02/08/2021, 14:41 - Gracou: Im a bit torn also bc on the one hand I want to see my friends in Devon and go horse riding and things but on the other hand I don’t rlly want to live w my parents
02/08/2021, 14:55 - Théodore Bedos: I won't be able to work until the 20th because of isolation, so you would have 20dya in Devon to see your friends and family
02/08/2021, 15:00 - Théodore Bedos: Seems to be a good mix
02/08/2021, 15:10 - Gracou: Ur right
02/08/2021, 15:11 - Gracou: Maybe we should consider bath then
02/08/2021, 15:11 - Gracou: But I’m still not sure we might get jobs at the hotel
02/08/2021, 15:13 - Théodore Bedos: Did you ask that women you wanted to call?
02/08/2021, 15:13 - Gracou: Yes she hasn’t replied
02/08/2021, 15:13 - Théodore Bedos: There are plenty of offers on the SU website for job during the year
02/08/2021, 15:14 - Théodore Bedos: Bar tender, hotel staff, etc etc
02/08/2021, 15:14 - Gracou: Wdym ‘during the year’
02/08/2021, 15:14 - Théodore Bedos: During the university year
02/08/2021, 15:14 - Théodore Bedos: Part time jobs to earn money while studying
02/08/2021, 15:14 - Gracou: Im reluctant to take a job during term time bc I think my grades will suffer
02/08/2021, 15:15 - Théodore Bedos: I think that I work better when I am busy
02/08/2021, 15:15 - Gracou: Baby you barely had enough time to see me last term
02/08/2021, 15:15 - Théodore Bedos: Otherwise, if I have too much time I do things at last minut
02/08/2021, 15:15 - Théodore Bedos: Yes but it should be easier this year
02/08/2021, 15:16 - Gracou: Why should it be easier this year
02/08/2021, 15:17 - Théodore Bedos: My 2nd year is known to be the worst
02/08/2021, 15:17 - Théodore Bedos: They should have us a lot less courseworks
02/08/2021, 15:17 - Gracou: Im not sure it’s the same for me
02/08/2021, 15:20 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway, except deliveroo for me, I don't know where I can find a job in Bath for in 2 weeks
02/08/2021, 15:27 - Gracou: I will see if I can find something
02/08/2021, 18:29 - Gracou: I have looked online btw and it seems like there are quite a lot of options for work in bath
02/08/2021, 18:30 - Théodore Bedos: Nice!!! what do you found
02/08/2021, 18:30 - Théodore Bedos: *Did you find
02/08/2021, 18:31 - Gracou: Just from the start of the search there seems to be bar work, work in hotels, work in restaurants, housekeeping and childcare that all seem to have good pay
02/08/2021, 18:32 - Gracou: I want to also see if there is anything like an estate agents and stuff
02/08/2021, 18:32 - Théodore Bedos: Where did you found that?
02/08/2021, 18:32 - Gracou: I haven’t looked for businessy jobs tho if u wanted to do that
02/08/2021, 18:32 - Gracou: https://uk.indeed.com/m/jobs?l=bath+area&mna=5&aceid=&gclid=CjwKCAjwr56IBhAvEiwA1fuqGoEti6xGEP23u1zmBulhmrqt3vSXYphD0Rz_ZQqntouJooy1xdFCzBoCKsYQAvD_BwE

02/08/2021, 18:34 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you want to check that in particular?
02/08/2021, 18:34 - Gracou: It could be cool for me to get some experience since I’m interested in property
02/08/2021, 18:34 - Théodore Bedos: Oh ok

02/08/2021, 18:36 - Gracou: Yeah you’re right
02/08/2021, 18:37 - Gracou: I think that housekeeping and childcare would mean we would be seperated so that leaves us with the other stuff

02/08/2021, 19:13 - Gracou: Well we just quit surely

03/08/2021, 10:27 - Gracou: Good morning gorgeous
03/08/2021, 10:45 - Théodore Bedos: Hi bella
03/08/2021, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: Good news I didn't break my ligament
03/08/2021, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: I just stretched it
03/08/2021, 10:46 - Gracou: Anna, Nicole and now some bitch called Bella? Theo when will u stop being unfaithful
03/08/2021, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: So I can remove the crutches and the straps
03/08/2021, 10:46 - Gracou: Oh that sounds great
03/08/2021, 10:47 - Gracou: How long will it take to heal?
03/08/2021, 10:47 - Théodore Bedos: 😉
03/08/2021, 10:47 - Théodore Bedos: It's already healed, I just need to reinforce it so that it doesn't happen again
03/08/2021, 11:40 - Théodore Bedos: I had a call from a company but they changed their need from 1-2 months to 3 months so I can't do it. But they said that they keep me in their list for their next position
03/08/2021, 11:41 - Gracou: How do u reinforce it?
03/08/2021, 11:41 - Gracou: Did they interview u?
03/08/2021, 11:41 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I had a phone interview
03/08/2021, 11:41 - Gracou: Ohhh interesting
03/08/2021, 11:41 - Théodore Bedos: I'll do exercise
03/08/2021, 11:42 - Gracou: L’osât
03/08/2021, 11:42 - Gracou: Okay
03/08/2021, 11:44 - Gracou: I haven’t applied to anything yet
03/08/2021, 11:45 - Gracou: To be honest when I suggested it I more meant it as an idea and hadn’t made my decision about it yet
03/08/2021, 11:45 - Gracou: It’s not that I don’t want to do it it’s just Im not 100% certain
03/08/2021, 12:37 - Gracou: Sweetheart?
03/08/2021, 12:57 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
03/08/2021, 13:03 - Gracou: Are you okay? You didn’t say anything?
03/08/2021, 13:13 - Théodore Bedos: I just did not know what to say, I am a bit surprise that you might prefer to stay in Devon without me instead of being together in Bath.
03/08/2021, 13:23 - Gracou: That’s not what I’m saying sweetheart it’s just that I think we should think everything through
03/08/2021, 13:24 - Gracou: Im really worried that it will put a lot of pressure on us if we are both living alone with no friends in bath and also working and paying bills that it will be difficult for our relationship
03/08/2021, 13:25 - Gracou: And also I’m worried that I will regress in myself, in the past I’ve sort of ditched my own life for the sake of devoting myself to my boyfriends and it hasn’t been very healthy for me
03/08/2021, 13:25 - Gracou: It’s just that I want to consider everything first babe
03/08/2021, 13:26 - Théodore Bedos: Do you really think that our relationship is that fragile?
03/08/2021, 13:27 - Théodore Bedos: We just spent 1 month together 24h/24h, how can it be more risky if we are occupied working half of the time
03/08/2021, 13:27 - Théodore Bedos: We will just be even more happy to see each other when we will
03/08/2021, 13:28 - Gracou: I know babe but in my experience it isn’t that simple bc it adds stress and things
03/08/2021, 13:29 - Gracou: And I still want to have a life outside our relationship
03/08/2021, 13:29 - Gracou: If I don’t have my own life I will become uninteresting anyway
03/08/2021, 13:30 - Théodore Bedos: Did I ever made you miss anything with your friend? I am always more than happy to meet your friend and I really don't mind being alone if you want to see friends alone.
03/08/2021, 13:31 - Théodore Bedos: Jim is in Bath, I'll see him aswell
03/08/2021, 13:31 - Théodore Bedos: I have my gym here too, I can get busy easily
03/08/2021, 13:32 - Gracou: I don’t have any friends that are in bath at the moment babe that’s more the problem
03/08/2021, 13:32 - Gracou: I don’t want to feel trapped in the house
03/08/2021, 13:33 - Gracou: Just to reiterate it’s not that I’m saying I don’t want to do it
03/08/2021, 13:34 - Théodore Bedos: Ok I see, I see
03/08/2021, 13:34 - Théodore Bedos: But you know we won't be far from Devon, you could go see family/friends in 2h
03/08/2021, 13:35 - Théodore Bedos: Bea in London aswell in 2h
03/08/2021, 13:35 - Gracou: Yes it’s still a little far but possible
03/08/2021, 13:36 - Gracou: I wouldn’t be able to just go out for lunch with Hannah if I had to drive 4 hours
03/08/2021, 13:37 - Théodore Bedos: Do you actually go just for lunch with Hannah if you have 1h drive up to her?
03/08/2021, 13:37 - Gracou: We can meet in the middle
03/08/2021, 13:37 - Théodore Bedos: You'll go for sleeping at her instead of lunch
03/08/2021, 13:37 - Théodore Bedos: Meet her at your house instead
03/08/2021, 13:37 - Théodore Bedos: Easy
03/08/2021, 13:38 - Gracou: It would be nice if there were some people in bath x I know of two people but I’m quite different to them I think
03/08/2021, 13:38 - Théodore Bedos: We will chill with Jim and Elena
03/08/2021, 13:39 - Théodore Bedos: And you might let people at work
03/08/2021, 13:39 - Gracou: Yes yes
03/08/2021, 13:39 - Théodore Bedos: Met*
03/08/2021, 13:39 - Gracou: Meet*
03/08/2021, 13:40 - Gracou: I think my parents won’t support me leaving as well
03/08/2021, 13:40 - Gracou: Especially if I tell them I plan on leaving after two days of being at home 😂
03/08/2021, 13:41 - Théodore Bedos: Why 2 days?
03/08/2021, 13:41 - Gracou: Bc I’ve been home for two days today
03/08/2021, 13:41 - Théodore Bedos: You can stay 20 days in Devon
03/08/2021, 13:41 - Théodore Bedos: That's quiet long
03/08/2021, 13:41 - Gracou: I thought about that and I want to start working before then
03/08/2021, 13:42 - Gracou: And if ur isolating u will want to do it in bath as well i guess I wouldn’t just leave u there
03/08/2021, 13:42 - Théodore Bedos: You can easily let me in Bath, I really don't mind
03/08/2021, 13:43 - Théodore Bedos: Is there actually even place for you at the hotel in Devon?
03/08/2021, 13:43 - Gracou: I don’t know she has read my message and not responded
03/08/2021, 14:04 - Gracou: When u made that special rice the other day, what flavourings did u use? Xx
03/08/2021, 14:05 - Théodore Bedos: Maji sauce, soya sauce, sesame oil
03/08/2021, 14:05 - Gracou: What is mani sauce?
03/08/2021, 14:13 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
03/08/2021, 14:13 - Théodore Bedos: Maggi*
03/08/2021, 14:37 - Gracou: Ahh
03/08/2021, 14:38 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
03/08/2021, 14:38 - Gracou: I only had soy sauce but al still gave it a thumbs up
03/08/2021, 14:55 - Théodore Bedos: Nice!
03/08/2021, 14:55 - Gracou: Thanks babe :)
03/08/2021, 14:56 - Théodore Bedos: I just had the interview with indeed flex and so now I can book shift with a lot of companies in bath, like Sainsbury, amazone warehouse, etc... Sounds usefull
03/08/2021, 14:56 - Gracou: Oh interesting
03/08/2021, 14:57 - Théodore Bedos: As well as bars, shops, restaurants
03/08/2021, 14:57 - Gracou: Can u book whatever hours you want?
03/08/2021, 14:57 - Théodore Bedos: Yes if there are shifts available
03/08/2021, 14:58 - Gracou: Oh that’s interesting
03/08/2021, 14:58 - Gracou: What was the interview like?
03/08/2021, 15:00 - Théodore Bedos: 30 min of a guy explaining how the app work and 30min of 1 to 1 interview where she asked me what we're my experiences and what I could do so that I receive offers accordingly
03/08/2021, 15:00 - Théodore Bedos: what were*
03/08/2021, 15:01 - Gracou: Ah cool

03/08/2021, 15:13 - Gracou: Baby stop melting my heart
03/08/2021, 15:15 - Théodore Bedos: But you put the wrong location
03/08/2021, 15:15 - Gracou: I couldn’t find la bastide
03/08/2021, 15:16 - Théodore Bedos: Labastide-clermont
03/08/2021, 15:17 - Gracou: I will change it
03/08/2021, 15:20 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks otherwise Mana will be angry
03/08/2021, 15:22 - Gracou: I really don’t want to upset mana
03/08/2021, 18:57 - Théodore Bedos: Apparently you can make a test on the 5th day of your quarantaine to shorten it
03/08/2021, 18:57 - Théodore Bedos: It's written on the website of the UK government
03/08/2021, 19:07 - Gracou: Yes I know
03/08/2021, 19:07 - Gracou: How come u mention it?
03/08/2021, 19:12 - Théodore Bedos: Because I was checking the rules for when I'll come
03/08/2021, 19:22 - Gracou: I think I will get the test to repasse
03/08/2021, 19:22 - Gracou: Release*
03/08/2021, 19:57 - Théodore Bedos: Is it the 5th day one?

03/08/2021, 19:58 - Gracou: I will have a look
03/08/2021, 19:58 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
03/08/2021, 19:58 - Gracou: U can do it in bath when u come
03/08/2021, 19:58 - Gracou: I will probably do it in exeter
03/08/2021, 20:04 - Théodore Bedos: Nice
03/08/2021, 20:05 - Théodore Bedos: Do you still have no news from the hotel?
03/08/2021, 20:05 - Gracou: No but my Nan thinks she is on holiday
03/08/2021, 20:08 - Théodore Bedos: Do you have a bit more an idea of what you wanna do?
03/08/2021, 20:09 - Théodore Bedos: We shouldn't decide to late
03/08/2021, 20:09 - Gracou: Yes I agree
03/08/2021, 20:09 - Gracou: I will make my mind up
03/08/2021, 20:26 - Théodore Bedos: I really want to live with you, if you tell me soon I could arrive soon
03/08/2021, 20:28 - Gracou: I thought you couldn’t come until the 10th?
03/08/2021, 20:42 - Théodore Bedos: Because I thought that my ligament was broken and I would need more rest, but I'm fine so I could come tomorrow if I wanted
03/08/2021, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: I just received an answer for a trial shift at bridge
03/08/2021, 21:06 - Théodore Bedos: On indeed it says that there are 5 positions available, you should apply
03/08/2021, 21:17 - Gracou: Maybe
03/08/2021, 21:17 - Gracou: I think u shouldn’t go right to work babe u need to fully fix ur ankle

04/08/2021, 09:32 - Théodore Bedos: Happy 5 months birthday 🎉🎉 The happiest 5 months of my life, I love you 😘
04/08/2021, 11:11 - Gracou: Ah baby well remembered!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️ sorry i didn’t see this message sooner! Happy 5 months I love you so much😘😘😘😘😘😘🌻 thank you for all the amazing memories we have made❤️
04/08/2021, 11:32 - Gracou: Are you okay darling?
04/08/2021, 11:32 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, why?
04/08/2021, 11:33 - Gracou: Just that u didn’t reply I thought u had taken it bad that I didn’t message u sooner
04/08/2021, 11:33 - Théodore Bedos: No of course not
04/08/2021, 11:34 - Théodore Bedos: I know that you can be busy
04/08/2021, 11:34 - Gracou: I wasn’t busy haha I just didn’t notice 😂❤️
04/08/2021, 11:34 - Théodore Bedos: Or that you can not notice
04/08/2021, 11:35 - Gracou: :)
04/08/2021, 12:03 - Gracou: Babe what would u think to the idea of moving to bath in September? U could come here on the 28th and do the test to release so we can be at my mums birthday party and then we go up to bath?
04/08/2021, 12:12 - Théodore Bedos: I'm not a big fan, that would let me way to few time to work. I also have to come back in September to go get my stuff and bring them back with my dad, so that would let me really no time to work
04/08/2021, 12:14 - Gracou: I see
04/08/2021, 12:15 - Théodore Bedos: Also, I just wanna be with you soon
04/08/2021, 12:15 - Gracou: I know baby
04/08/2021, 12:16 - Gracou: I don’t think I should leave devon for a few weeks
04/08/2021, 12:16 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
04/08/2021, 12:17 - Gracou: Because soon I will be working and won’t have the time to just stay at home with my family. I don’t want to completely throw that away and I know it will upset them if I do
04/08/2021, 12:18 - Gracou: Bc also what is it going to be like at Christmas too, we won’t want to separate either and both of us will have to compromise and stuff so I just don’t want to throw away time here as it’s one of my last chances but I will have lots of chances to live with you
04/08/2021, 12:20 - Gracou: Do you understand where I’m coming from?
04/08/2021, 12:26 - Théodore Bedos: No I really don't understand.
First at Christmas their won't be any issue, I don't mind separating at this time.

Second you have already been with your family all the month of June, now you'll be with them for 2 weeks and you would also see them at the end of September. 
You can't work in Devon and they piss you off when you are there. So why do you want to spend all August there??? I think that it feels good to be home because you just came back but you are gonna regret that decision in 2 weeks and get bored there. Trust someone that has spent the last 4 years away from home. I know that feeling
04/08/2021, 12:28 - Gracou: Baby I was with them for 2 weeks in June and only one of them was at home. Why would I see them at the end of September? No babe I literally suggested bath bc I already wanted to leave home I’ve just reflected on it
04/08/2021, 12:28 - Gracou: I know I’m probably gunna be pissed by next week
04/08/2021, 12:30 - Théodore Bedos: So why do you wanna do that????
04/08/2021, 12:31 - Gracou: It feels like the right decision anyway
04/08/2021, 12:33 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
04/08/2021, 12:33 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
04/08/2021, 12:33 - Gracou: I tried calling u!
04/08/2021, 12:58 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué

04/08/2021, 13:12 - Gracou: My Prince
04/08/2021, 15:18 - Gracou: Could we do week commencing the 23rd for bath? 😁
04/08/2021, 15:19 - Gracou: Come to Devon on the 16th?
04/08/2021, 15:31 - Gracou: Also my grandad thought we were getting married which I found funny
04/08/2021, 15:41 - Théodore Bedos: Ahaha why?
04/08/2021, 15:42 - Théodore Bedos: Don't you wanna work a bit more than a month?
04/08/2021, 15:42 - Gracou: He thought that was what me and my dad have been talking about😂🤦🏽‍♀️
04/08/2021, 15:42 - Théodore Bedos: Would be cool if I could come on the 9th/10th and start working on the 16th
04/08/2021, 15:45 - Gracou: Ffs expert medicals is a scam
04/08/2021, 15:45 - Gracou: I have had to pay another £100 to get tested today
04/08/2021, 15:45 - Théodore Bedos: Oh shite, how come?
04/08/2021, 15:46 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
04/08/2021, 15:52 - Théodore Bedos: I am sorry babe
04/08/2021, 15:52 - Théodore Bedos: The link was on the UK government website, I thought it was safe
04/08/2021, 15:53 - Gracou: Babe that really isn’t your fault XX
04/08/2021, 15:53 - Gracou: I’ve booked a test for tomorrow in person
04/08/2021, 15:58 - Gracou: I am really trying to find the solution that appeases my parents and appeases u the most sweetheart❤️ that’s why I am suggesting the 23rd
04/08/2021, 15:58 - Théodore Bedos: It's crazy, it was on the UK website
04/08/2021, 15:58 - Gracou: It’s nuts ur right
04/08/2021, 15:59 - Gracou: So basically with everything it will be £270 for my isolation - I think u need to bring all of ur stuff with u babe so u don’t have to pay that twice
04/08/2021, 16:01 - Théodore Bedos: That's true, I'll think seriously about a way
04/08/2021, 16:02 - Théodore Bedos: Is it your parents who asked you for the 23rd or is it you would expect them to ask you that
04/08/2021, 16:03 - Gracou: No I went downstairs and said 16th and he said no, 23rd please
04/08/2021, 16:05 - Théodore Bedos: The thing is just that I am worried to go and not find a job, I have offers now but I am worried that I can't have the same offer if I arrive at the end of August.
For instance, I said to bridge that I could not do my trial this Friday but maybe in 2 weeks, and they answered no problem, I'm not sure that they will still accept in 3 weeks
04/08/2021, 16:06 - Théodore Bedos: Could I arrive in the 9, do my quarantaine with you on up to the 16th in Devon, love to Bath alone first and you join me after?
04/08/2021, 16:07 - Gracou: Yes you could do that
04/08/2021, 16:10 - Théodore Bedos: Sounds like a plan!!
04/08/2021, 16:10 - Gracou: Yay❤️❤️❤️
04/08/2021, 16:14 - Théodore Bedos: Let's do that I'll talk with my parents to see if he can drop me there or if he can drop my stuff in September if he have to come to England
04/08/2021, 16:16 - Gracou: Cool!
04/08/2021, 16:16 - Gracou: I still need to find a job tho
04/08/2021, 16:16 - Théodore Bedos: Let's beauty
04/08/2021, 16:16 - Théodore Bedos: Let's go beauty
04/08/2021, 16:17 - Gracou: ❤️❤️
04/08/2021, 16:26 - Théodore Bedos: I feel so much better with things planned
04/08/2021, 16:44 - Gracou: Yes it is better
04/08/2021, 16:52 - Gracou: Im reallly looking forward to seeing you
04/08/2021, 18:31 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
04/08/2021, 18:31 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
04/08/2021, 18:39 - Théodore Bedos: 9=0 10=1 11=2 12=3 13=4 14=5
04/08/2021, 18:39 - Théodore Bedos: If I arrive on the 9th I can be free on the 15th then, cool
04/08/2021, 18:40 - Théodore Bedos: Are you ok? Does it means something bad for you that they told you that?
04/08/2021, 18:41 - Gracou: Are u planning on arriving that early?
04/08/2021, 18:41 - Gracou: It’s just so frustrating none of the people on the phone seem to know what they’re talking about
04/08/2021, 18:43 - Théodore Bedos: You said: yes we could do that
04/08/2021, 18:43 - Gracou: Brain fart
04/08/2021, 18:43 - Gracou: Ur right
04/08/2021, 18:44 - Théodore Bedos: But I can do the 10th if you prefere
04/08/2021, 18:45 - Théodore Bedos: I want to come see you babe, but you make me feel like you don't want much, not sure I want to come if it doesn't make you happy
04/08/2021, 18:46 - Gracou: Baby of course it makes me happy❤️ I love you
04/08/2021, 18:46 - Gracou: I don’t want you to feel unwanted it isn’t like that x
04/08/2021, 18:48 - Théodore Bedos: Ok, nice
04/08/2021, 18:48 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't want to force you
04/08/2021, 18:48 - Théodore Bedos: Let's do the nine as we said then
04/08/2021, 18:48 - Gracou: Okay
04/08/2021, 18:49 - Gracou: Im just trying to balance everything xxx I love being with u
04/08/2021, 18:49 - Gracou: Are u going to bring all ur stuff?
04/08/2021, 18:49 - Théodore Bedos: I haven't seen my parent yet
04/08/2021, 18:50 - Gracou: Ah i see :)
04/08/2021, 21:52 - Gracou: Any update? I’m curious
04/08/2021, 22:00 - Gracou: babe they changed the rules
04/08/2021, 22:00 - Gracou: U don’t need to quarantine when u come
04/08/2021, 22:00 - Théodore Bedos: Just now??
04/08/2021, 22:00 - Théodore Bedos: Oh really?
04/08/2021, 22:04 - Théodore Bedos: Where did you see that?
04/08/2021, 22:10 - Gracou: My dad saw it on the news
04/08/2021, 22:10 - Gracou: My mum just called to tell me
04/08/2021, 22:15 - Théodore Bedos: Ok nice
04/08/2021, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: I checked and if I go directly from Normandy to take the boat it's gonna cost 500 euro of boat for my dad to go both ways. So I might go with just a luggage and my dad would go by car later in September if he needs to go to london
04/08/2021, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: But not sure, maybe we will just pay
04/08/2021, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: Or I'll go directly by car from Paris
04/08/2021, 22:42 - Gracou: Since u don’t have to quarantine that makes it cheaper for u to go twice
04/08/2021, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: I have no quarantaine but I still have to buy the 2 tests
04/08/2021, 22:47 - Gracou: Ohhh i see well done for checking x
04/08/2021, 23:42 - Théodore Bedos: Babe, I just realised a bumped in my belly button, my parents thinks it's a hernia, I'm going to check with a doctor tomorrow but I might have to be operated if it is one
04/08/2021, 23:42 - Gracou: Oh no babe
04/08/2021, 23:42 - Gracou: Are you in any pain?
04/08/2021, 23:43 - Gracou: Can u push the lump back in?
04/08/2021, 23:43 - Théodore Bedos: No I don't have pain and honestly I have no idea of when it could have happened because I have done no weight lifting in a month
04/08/2021, 23:44 - Théodore Bedos: I don't really want to push on it babe
04/08/2021, 23:44 - Gracou: Okay it just said online that with hernias u can sometimes push them back in
04/08/2021, 23:44 - Gracou: Is it big?
04/08/2021, 23:44 - Gracou: Are you calm about itV
04/08/2021, 23:46 - Gracou: Baby I know u don’t want to but if u can’t push the hernia in then it says you should go to A&E
04/08/2021, 23:46 - Théodore Bedos: What's A&E
04/08/2021, 23:47 - Gracou: Accident and emergency, it’s where u go if u injure urself badly or need emergency operation
04/08/2021, 23:48 - Théodore Bedos: When they told me that I panicked quiet a bit because I am supposed to leave for Normandy tomorrow and if I have to be operated it's gonna take me long before I can see you and be able to work also
04/08/2021, 23:48 - Théodore Bedos: I'm going to see the doctor tomorrow, I will see what he says
04/08/2021, 23:48 - Gracou: Please can u try to push it for me?
04/08/2021, 23:49 - Théodore Bedos: Why the hell do you wnat me to do that ?!!!!
04/08/2021, 23:50 - Gracou: Because if you can’t push it in then it means you probably have a problem with your organs/blood supply which is obviously a very big issue baby!
04/08/2021, 23:51 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
04/08/2021, 23:51 - Théodore Bedos: Even if it goes back in I am not gonna be like ok, it was just a hernia fine, I would still see the doctor so I'd rather see that with him before trying to push on my stomach
04/08/2021, 23:51 - Gracou: Obviously ur going to see the doctor either way
04/08/2021, 23:51 - Gracou: But if u can’t push it in u need to go to the hospital right now
04/08/2021, 23:52 - Gracou: Will u send me a picture?
05/08/2021, 00:05 - Gracou: U okay?
05/08/2021, 00:05 - Théodore Bedos: null
05/08/2021, 00:06 - Théodore Bedos: On the left the part that is a bit pumped
05/08/2021, 00:06 - Théodore Bedos: My parents says that it is ridiculous to get worried about a hernia
05/08/2021, 00:07 - Théodore Bedos: And so I'll wait Friday to see a doctor
05/08/2021, 00:07 - Gracou: Did u push it?
05/08/2021, 00:07 - Gracou: Ur going to wait until Friday?
05/08/2021, 00:09 - Théodore Bedos: I pushed slightly on it but I told you I am not going to push hard on it by myself
05/08/2021, 00:09 - Gracou: Okay well thank you for trying
05/08/2021, 00:09 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I am probably going to wait until Friday to
05/08/2021, 00:10 - Gracou: I just want u to be okay
05/08/2021, 00:11 - Théodore Bedos: I really don't like this, I nearly fainted when I realised it could be that
05/08/2021, 00:11 - Théodore Bedos: you know how much I hate needles
05/08/2021, 00:12 - Théodore Bedos: so thinking that I have a piece of stomach leaving my tummy is 🤮🤮
05/08/2021, 00:28 - Gracou: Im sorry baby should I not have sent you the screenshot?
05/08/2021, 00:31 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe not
05/08/2021, 00:31 - Théodore Bedos: But it's ok
05/08/2021, 00:31 - Gracou: Sorry sweetheart
05/08/2021, 00:31 - Gracou: I wanted u to get why I was asking u to push it
05/08/2021, 00:31 - Gracou: Are u having trouble sleeping?
05/08/2021, 00:38 - Gracou: I think I’m going to go to sleep now, I love you
05/08/2021, 00:38 - Théodore Bedos: I'm about to go as well
05/08/2021, 00:38 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you for your help and your worrying
05/08/2021, 00:39 - Théodore Bedos: I love you so much, I am mainly pissed because it could delay when I would see you
05/08/2021, 00:39 - Gracou: Yeah I’m sad about that too :/
05/08/2021, 10:11 - Gracou: Babe the universe slightly hates us
05/08/2021, 10:11 - Gracou: Darcy has covid
05/08/2021, 10:12 - Gracou: Im trying to convince my dad to put her in the annexe and move my grandparents in here so that we don’t have to isolate and u can still come
05/08/2021, 10:18 - Théodore Bedos: Ahaha, right
05/08/2021, 10:18 - Théodore Bedos: How do you know that she has covid? did she get tested?
05/08/2021, 10:19 - Théodore Bedos: You probably all have it already honestly
05/08/2021, 10:19 - Gracou: My dad took a test yesterday he doesnt
05/08/2021, 10:19 - Gracou: We aren’t in contact with her she is in Cornwall
05/08/2021, 10:19 - Gracou: And yes she has been tested
05/08/2021, 10:19 - Théodore Bedos: yeah but it can still appear in the next days
05/08/2021, 10:19 - Théodore Bedos: Oh she is not at home?
05/08/2021, 10:20 - Gracou: No
05/08/2021, 10:20 - Gracou: But I think she probably had it when she was at home and we probs got it from her then
05/08/2021, 10:20 - Gracou: But idk, will take a test when the cleaner has left
05/08/2021, 10:22 - Théodore Bedos: It's funny that you went to France during a month, while in Uk everyone was saying that France was a RED country for covid and when you come back it is your sister who was at country side who has it
05/08/2021, 10:22 - Gracou: It’s bc Darcy is so reckless and keeps going out clubbing and stuff
05/08/2021, 10:22 - Théodore Bedos: I don't get it where is she? In Cornwall or in Devon
05/08/2021, 10:24 - Gracou: Im Cornwall right now
05/08/2021, 10:24 - Gracou: But she was in Devon before
05/08/2021, 10:25 - Théodore Bedos: When did you went to cormwall?
05/08/2021, 10:25 - Gracou: In*
05/08/2021, 10:25 - Gracou: Im in Devon baby
05/08/2021, 10:26 - Théodore Bedos: I thought you were in Cornwall
05/08/2021, 10:26 - Gracou: No
05/08/2021, 10:27 - Théodore Bedos: And where is your familly in Devon or in Carmwall
05/08/2021, 10:27 - Gracou: Darcy is in Cornwall rn, the im is a typo of in
05/08/2021, 10:27 - Gracou: Al is in Devon, Rachel is in Warrington
05/08/2021, 10:28 - Théodore Bedos: Who is Darcy with in Carmwall
05/08/2021, 10:28 - Gracou: Friends
05/08/2021, 10:29 - Théodore Bedos: Oh nice, then maybe you won't have it
05/08/2021, 10:29 - Théodore Bedos: What made her think that she has it?
05/08/2021, 10:29 - Gracou: I hope so
05/08/2021, 10:29 - Gracou: She tested positive
05/08/2021, 10:29 - Gracou: And she is feeling unwell
05/08/2021, 10:30 - Théodore Bedos: Did you got the result from your day2 test you did?
05/08/2021, 10:30 - Gracou: No I’m supposed to be doing that today, but I need to test myself and make sure I don’t have covid first
05/08/2021, 10:39 - Gracou: Also random question
05/08/2021, 10:39 - Gracou: Do u think ur mum likes me
05/08/2021, 10:44 - Théodore Bedos: Yes of course she does!!
05/08/2021, 10:44 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you ask?
05/08/2021, 10:45 - Théodore Bedos: Did you had a bad feeling?
05/08/2021, 10:45 - Gracou: Well I thought she thought I was fine but she definitely doesn’t like me as much as ur dad
05/08/2021, 10:46 - Gracou: I wondered whether it was just that she didn’t want to say anything like with my muscateer too
05/08/2021, 10:49 - Théodore Bedos: Babe she really appreciate you, she is just not as much in the excess as my dad
05/08/2021, 10:52 - Théodore Bedos: Mums are a bit protective about their son, and dads thinks that they are buddys and they need to make you like me. So my dad is a bit in the excess to be sure you have a good time, my mum just want to be sure that you like me so she doesn't overact
05/08/2021, 10:52 - Théodore Bedos: But she really appreciate you
05/08/2021, 10:54 - Gracou: Ahhhh I see ;) I was just wondering xx
05/08/2021, 11:49 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
05/08/2021, 11:49 - Théodore Bedos: Is any of those two yours?
05/08/2021, 11:49 - Gracou: Oh those are mine haha!
05/08/2021, 11:49 - Théodore Bedos: Both?
05/08/2021, 11:57 - Gracou: Definitely the one on the left
05/08/2021, 11:58 - Gracou: Potentially the other
05/08/2021, 13:03 - Gracou: How likely do ur parents think it is that u will have surgery on ur hernia?
05/08/2021, 13:03 - Théodore Bedos: If it is one, I'll have to
05/08/2021, 13:03 - Gracou: Babe maybe u got it from sex hahhahahaha it’s probably that remember u said u rlly exhausted urself in one of the positions
05/08/2021, 13:04 - Théodore Bedos: Probably, but it's wierd because I never push really really hard
05/08/2021, 13:04 - Gracou: U fucked me so hard ur bowel ruptured😂😂😂
05/08/2021, 13:04 - Gracou: Remember the position where I was on my knees and u had one of ur legs high up, it was probably that
05/08/2021, 13:05 - Théodore Bedos: It's tyring because it's intense but it's not like doing a heavy lift where I push really hard
05/08/2021, 13:05 - Gracou: I see
05/08/2021, 13:06 - Gracou: How long will u have to stay in France is ur operated on?
05/08/2021, 13:06 - Théodore Bedos: Not long it's a very short operation
05/08/2021, 13:06 - Théodore Bedos: I could probably leave the next day or the one after
05/08/2021, 13:06 - Gracou: Yes but is the recovery long? Bc it messed w ur tummy muscles
05/08/2021, 13:06 - Gracou: Oh u can leave that soon?
05/08/2021, 13:07 - Théodore Bedos: It's really not a big cut in the muscle, I will be able to walk after it
05/08/2021, 13:16 - Gracou: Cool :)
05/08/2021, 13:19 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
05/08/2021, 13:53 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks baby

05/08/2021, 19:11 - Gracou: I came up with the idea of all the healthy people who tested negative living in the main house and then putting Darcy in the annexe so we don’t have to quarantine
05/08/2021, 19:17 - Gracou: Didn’t mean to call! Have a nice karaoke!

05/08/2021, 19:26 - Gracou: Didn’t mean to call again
05/08/2021, 19:27 - Théodore Bedos: So much better to do a quarantaine here than in my room in Paris

05/08/2021, 23:28 - Gracou: It is a different type of nugget
05/08/2021, 23:28 - Théodore Bedos: I'm staying in our room
05/08/2021, 23:28 - Gracou: Aw our room
05/08/2021, 23:28 - Gracou: Is that where u normally stay?
05/08/2021, 23:28 - Théodore Bedos: Sometimes
05/08/2021, 23:29 - Théodore Bedos: I have been watching for the last 2hourd the 50km walks
05/08/2021, 23:29 - Gracou: Im really wishing we were together right now
05/08/2021, 23:29 - Théodore Bedos: With my dad
05/08/2021, 23:29 - Gracou: What walks?
05/08/2021, 23:29 - Théodore Bedos: 50km walk
05/08/2021, 23:30 - Théodore Bedos: It's a race where you can only walk
05/08/2021, 23:30 - Gracou: I’ve not heard of it
05/08/2021, 23:30 - Théodore Bedos: If both of your feet go off the floor at the same time you are disqualified
05/08/2021, 23:31 - Théodore Bedos: It's soooo boring but I don't know why we have been hyptnotised for the last 2h
05/08/2021, 23:31 - Gracou: That’s quite stressful actually what sort of terrain are they on?
05/08/2021, 23:31 - Gracou: Ça c’est vraiment toi
05/08/2021, 23:33 - Théodore Bedos: They are on the road
05/08/2021, 23:33 - Gracou: I bet they look very stupid
05/08/2021, 23:34 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
05/08/2021, 23:35 - Théodore Bedos: So stupid
05/08/2021, 23:35 - Gracou: Hahahaha
05/08/2021, 23:36 - Gracou: I can’t believe u have been watching it for two hours😂
05/08/2021, 23:36 - Gracou: And that you are so into it you haven’t been on your ohone😂😂😂
05/08/2021, 23:36 - Gracou: It’s not even as if ur casually watching it
05/08/2021, 23:41 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I'm really in it
05/08/2021, 23:41 - Théodore Bedos: There is frenchy
05/08/2021, 23:42 - Gracou: And he is almost about to win let me guess

05/08/2021, 23:42 - Théodore Bedos: Last time he popped himself and walk 30km with his poop
05/08/2021, 23:42 - Gracou: I can imagine the only crazy stuff that happens in this sport is blisters
05/08/2021, 23:42 - Gracou: Hahahahahahahah wth
05/08/2021, 23:42 - Gracou: Why did he poop himself
05/08/2021, 23:43 - Théodore Bedos: The time before he fainted, stand back up for a few km, fainted , and dud that 3/4 times
05/08/2021, 23:43 - Théodore Bedos: He popped himself for not loosing time
05/08/2021, 23:44 - Gracou: This is sk strange how do u poo whilst speed walking
05/08/2021, 23:45 - Théodore Bedos: Today he started ahead, stopped to go to the toilet, took 30 min to come back on the head, then stopped again for no reasons, then cat h back the head after 1 hour so easily and now he just gave up again
05/08/2021, 23:46 - Gracou: What a strange man
05/08/2021, 23:46 - Théodore Bedos: Its not like if he was pooping a hard perfectly molded poo, it was very liquid like diarrhea
05/08/2021, 23:47 - Théodore Bedos: That's so sad to see him giving up, he is very attaching
05/08/2021, 23:47 - Théodore Bedos: Everyone like him
05/08/2021, 23:47 - Théodore Bedos: Also when he came back so easily today I really thought that he could win
05/08/2021, 23:52 - Gracou: Did u see it on camera?
05/08/2021, 23:52 - Gracou: Why is he giving up :(
05/08/2021, 23:53 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I saw it on camera
05/08/2021, 23:53 - Gracou: Oh
05/08/2021, 23:53 - Gracou: How did u see it
05/08/2021, 23:54 - Théodore Bedos: Because it was dripping a bit, and because he was cleaning his but while walking with big sponges
05/08/2021, 23:54 - Gracou: Where did the sponges come from
06/08/2021, 00:09 - Théodore Bedos: The support teams on the side
06/08/2021, 00:11 - Gracou: Interesting that they keep large sponges
06/08/2021, 00:12 - Gracou: Im going to sleep now baby I love you with my whole heart xx
06/08/2021, 00:15 - Théodore Bedos: It happened more than once
06/08/2021, 00:15 - Théodore Bedos: Love you
06/08/2021, 00:15 - Gracou: To different people?
06/08/2021, 00:15 - Gracou: I love you
06/08/2021, 00:16 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
06/08/2021, 09:43 - Gracou: Good luck at your doctors appointment xo
06/08/2021, 10:07 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks
06/08/2021, 10:07 - Théodore Bedos: I'm in the waiting room
06/08/2021, 10:30 - Gracou: Tell me how it goes
06/08/2021, 10:43 - Théodore Bedos: The doctor said that I should keep it like that and if goes worst I should go see a doctor again.
I think it's the stupidest thing that I ever heard, she is just seeing fat old country side retired people every day and she doesn't understand that I do intense sport everyday and that it is going to become worst for sure
06/08/2021, 10:44 - Théodore Bedos: And I don't want to have it being bad if I'm in England because it will cost me a lot to have it fixed in the UK
06/08/2021, 10:45 - Théodore Bedos: And I just don't want to have to fixed it while I'm in exames for example
06/08/2021, 10:47 - Gracou: Ugh that’s annoying
06/08/2021, 10:47 - Gracou: Can u not have it fixed in the uk since ur a student?
06/08/2021, 10:48 - Théodore Bedos: I don't think so, I think it would cost me a lot as I am not british
06/08/2021, 10:49 - Gracou: Dammit
06/08/2021, 10:49 - Gracou: What are you going to do then?
06/08/2021, 10:50 - Théodore Bedos: I'm going to go to the emergency to do an echography directly because I don't like what she said
06/08/2021, 11:02 - Gracou: Yes good idea

06/08/2021, 12:19 - Théodore Bedos: Why can I not send the boob picture?
06/08/2021, 12:19 - Gracou: Bc then it will come up on my ohone
06/08/2021, 12:19 - Gracou: It’s okay I’ve deleted it on my phone
06/08/2021, 12:20 - Théodore Bedos: And what's wrong with that?
06/08/2021, 12:20 - Théodore Bedos: Where are you now?
06/08/2021, 12:20 - Gracou: The airport
06/08/2021, 12:21 - Gracou: My Apple account is connected to my dad so I don’t like to have naked pics of myself on my phone
06/08/2021, 12:21 - Gracou: He can’t see them but I don’t want to risk it basically
06/08/2021, 12:26 - Gracou: Also baby
06/08/2021, 12:26 - Gracou: When do u think u will be able to come
06/08/2021, 12:30 - Théodore Bedos: Alright
06/08/2021, 12:30 - Théodore Bedos: Why are you at the airport
06/08/2021, 12:31 - Gracou: For my day 5 test
06/08/2021, 12:31 - Théodore Bedos: I'm still in the waiting room, I will have to tell you after I see the doctor
06/08/2021, 12:31 - Gracou: Sorry not getting on a flight to France
06/08/2021, 12:31 - Théodore Bedos: It's ok
06/08/2021, 12:31 - Théodore Bedos: I forgive you
06/08/2021, 12:31 - Gracou: I have been missing it tho
06/08/2021, 12:32 - Gracou: I’ve been watching my Parisian programme and I’m going to my Nan : that’s right where theo lives! I’ve been to that park! That is next to his dads shop!
06/08/2021, 12:32 - Gracou: Getting so excited
06/08/2021, 12:37 - Théodore Bedos: Ahhaa, that's cool
06/08/2021, 14:38 - Théodore Bedos: Ok so apparently there is nothing I can do right now, I'll have to deal with it and book an appointment with. Chirurgien for Christmas
06/08/2021, 14:39 - Gracou: Why can’t u do anything now?
06/08/2021, 14:41 - Théodore Bedos: Because they don't have enough people in the emergency to operate this if it doesn't hurt. It's not a priority. If I want to remove it I need to see a private chirurgien, but in August they are nearly all in hollidays
06/08/2021, 14:41 - Théodore Bedos: So I will never have an appointment with him and an operation before a month
06/08/2021, 15:31 - Gracou: Oh gosh
06/08/2021, 15:31 - Gracou: U should have said that it hurt
06/08/2021, 15:31 - Gracou: Will u still be able to do sports?
06/08/2021, 15:51 - Théodore Bedos: According to the last doctor I saw it is probably a kist and not an hernia
06/08/2021, 15:51 - Théodore Bedos: Which prove how shite was the first doctor I saw this morning
06/08/2021, 15:52 - Gracou: Kist? Do u mean a sist?
06/08/2021, 15:53 - Théodore Bedos: Cyst in English
06/08/2021, 15:53 - Gracou: So how do u treat it
06/08/2021, 15:54 - Théodore Bedos: So I am going to do an echography, to see if it's an hernia or a cyst
06/08/2021, 15:54 - Théodore Bedos: And if it is a cyst, it is just going to leave by itself in a week
06/08/2021, 15:55 - Gracou: Oh phew
06/08/2021, 15:55 - Gracou: Can u get the échographie today?
06/08/2021, 16:21 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe before I leave
06/08/2021, 16:21 - Théodore Bedos: But it's fine if not
06/08/2021, 16:47 - Gracou: Okay
06/08/2021, 16:47 - Gracou: I just want to know that ur coming soon!

08/08/2021, 18:50 - Théodore Bedos: What do you mean by option?
08/08/2021, 18:50 - Gracou: Im glad u can play again
08/08/2021, 18:50 - Gracou: I didn’t know which would be best so Rachel got me two bc she liked the other one
08/08/2021, 18:51 - Théodore Bedos: I played in jeans so not even close to 100%

08/08/2021, 18:57 - Théodore Bedos: I'll try but there is no Uniqlo in Normandy and no Uniqlo in bath
08/08/2021, 18:57 - Théodore Bedos: I'm not really good at ordering online
08/08/2021, 18:57 - Théodore Bedos: I'll see
08/08/2021, 19:02 - Gracou: Surely u can just order the exact same thing u had before?
08/08/2021, 19:03 - Théodore Bedos: I'm not sure they keep the exact same models every year
08/08/2021, 19:04 - Gracou: I see
08/08/2021, 19:04 - Gracou: Surely u can check tho?
08/08/2021, 19:04 - Théodore Bedos: Not sure the relugar fit Jeans of 2019 are the same than the one in 2021
08/08/2021, 19:04 - Gracou: True
08/08/2021, 19:04 - Théodore Bedos: It's not like in Levi's where I know that a 501 is always a 501
08/08/2021, 19:28 - Gracou: Yeah I see
08/08/2021, 19:33 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
08/08/2021, 19:34 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
08/08/2021, 19:35 - Théodore Bedos: I did it without asking why first but can you tell me why now?
08/08/2021, 19:35 - Gracou: Mummy wanted to know how
08/08/2021, 21:02 - Théodore Bedos: I applied to 3 Sainsbury jobs. If you apply for service assistant (I guess this is just inshop staff) you can already book an interview
08/08/2021, 21:02 - Théodore Bedos: I did on Wednesday at 1p.o
08/08/2021, 21:02 - Théodore Bedos: 1p.m
08/08/2021, 21:07 - Gracou: Hmm I thought I had applied for that one :/ I will have to check tomorrow
08/08/2021, 21:11 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
08/08/2021, 21:11 - Théodore Bedos: On your profile
08/08/2021, 21:11 - Théodore Bedos: I also have it for service assistant now
08/08/2021, 21:11 - Gracou: Ohhh cool!
08/08/2021, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: Oh I'm stupid that's the same job (service assistant) but somewhere else
08/08/2021, 21:14 - Gracou: Hmm it’s not letting me into my account
08/08/2021, 21:14 - Gracou: Haha
08/08/2021, 21:27 - Théodore Bedos: Actually no it's the same job, at the same place but with different time table. So if you can access that page that I sreenshooted you could see the timetable of the job that you applied to. It's only 3 days a week and not the same day. So it would be nice to have some days in common. We would have no free time together if we work different days always.
08/08/2021, 21:28 - Gracou: Yes that would be rlly unpleasant
08/08/2021, 21:28 - Théodore Bedos: Also babe, I need to book a day 2 test, where do you think I should do it? Should I try to order a home kit or should you bring to an in site test
08/08/2021, 21:29 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
08/08/2021, 21:35 - Théodore Bedos: All website seems to be scams for home test, where did you do your onsite test for day 2?
08/08/2021, 21:49 - Gracou: Gpdq at exeter airport
08/08/2021, 21:49 - Gracou: I don’t mind driving you I can show you exeter city afterwards x
08/08/2021, 22:26 - Théodore Bedos: 99 pounds!! Just for a day 2 test their, that's crazy
08/08/2021, 22:26 - Gracou: Yep
08/08/2021, 22:26 - Gracou: I have paid £300
08/08/2021, 22:26 - Gracou: Not including the ones we booked in Paris
08/08/2021, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: Awfull
08/08/2021, 22:47 - Théodore Bedos: I'm gonna try to make longer research to find a reliable home kit tommorow
08/08/2021, 22:47 - Théodore Bedos: Otherwise I'll do the airport one
08/08/2021, 22:49 - Gracou: You would only need to pay £200 bc u don’t do the day 5 test to release
08/08/2021, 23:02 - Théodore Bedos: No just 100, I don't have to do the day8
08/08/2021, 23:02 - Théodore Bedos: Just day 2
08/08/2021, 23:03 - Gracou: Oh okay that’s good :)
08/08/2021, 23:05 - Théodore Bedos: Good night babe
08/08/2021, 23:05 - Théodore Bedos: 1 more day to wait and I'll be with you
08/08/2021, 23:05 - Théodore Bedos: I love
08/08/2021, 23:05 - Théodore Bedos: You
08/08/2021, 23:37 - Gracou: I love you so much I am so looking forward to being with you again❤️
09/08/2021, 10:17 - Théodore Bedos: What is your address in bath?
09/08/2021, 10:17 - Théodore Bedos: I need it quick please
09/08/2021, 10:36 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/08/2021, 10:57 - Théodore Bedos: I just had an interview offer with Sainsbury for online assistant
09/08/2021, 10:58 - Gracou: Ooo
09/08/2021, 10:58 - Gracou: I couldn’t log into my account when I tried yesterday which is annoying :/
09/08/2021, 11:00 - Théodore Bedos: go here
09/08/2021, 11:00 - Théodore Bedos: https://hdhe.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX/my-profile/sign-in
09/08/2021, 11:35 - Gracou: What time do u think u Willl arrive in bath babe?
09/08/2021, 11:56 - Gracou: Wait so what time are u getting on the boat in Normandy?
09/08/2021, 11:58 - Gracou: I rlly wasn’t expecting you to get there so early
09/08/2021, 12:03 - Théodore Bedos: Ahaha sorry
09/08/2021, 12:03 - Théodore Bedos: You'll have to go to bed early
09/08/2021, 12:04 - Gracou: J have to get up at 6 gross :(
09/08/2021, 12:07 - Gracou: The earliest slot I could get to pick up the keys was 9:45 fyi
09/08/2021, 13:27 - Théodore Bedos: It's fine, we arrive at 6:45 actually so it will fit perfectly I think
09/08/2021, 13:27 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you bbae
09/08/2021, 13:27 - Théodore Bedos: Babe
09/08/2021, 13:39 - Théodore Bedos: I have made the scanner and it's a hernia
09/08/2021, 13:39 - Gracou: Ugh really
09/08/2021, 13:40 - Gracou: How do u feel?
09/08/2021, 13:40 - Gracou: Are they going to operate or leave it?
09/08/2021, 13:43 - Théodore Bedos: I can't do anything know, I'll book an appointment with a surgery specialist to be operated at Christmas
09/08/2021, 13:43 - Gracou: I see I see
09/08/2021, 13:43 - Gracou: Sorry babe I know it must be really annoying for you
09/08/2021, 13:43 - Gracou: Do they have any idea what caused it?
09/08/2021, 13:47 - Théodore Bedos: The guy say that if it is that small and we can't push it back in it means that I had it for a while (maybe years). If it is that then it means that it doesn't change much to my life. 
But I really don't think that I had it for a while. I really look often at my body (gym dude classic...) And I'm sure that it wasn't there
09/08/2021, 16:09 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/08/2021, 16:09 - Gracou: Yeah and I’ve never felt it there I feel like I might have noticed too
09/08/2021, 16:45 - Théodore Bedos: Can you please print the form that I just sent to you and bring it to bath
09/08/2021, 16:46 - Théodore Bedos: We don't have a printer here and my dad need it to come back to France
09/08/2021, 16:57 - Gracou: Okay babe
09/08/2021, 22:53 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight babe

09/08/2021, 23:09 - Gracou: Baby why are u still awake!
09/08/2021, 23:10 - Théodore Bedos: Because we came in the boat at 11 and then we had beers while playing a game with my dad
09/08/2021, 23:11 - Gracou: I didn’t realise u left tonight! Are u in a cabin on the boat?

23/09/2021, 13:15 - Gracou: Of course babe I’m rlly upset that it happened
23/09/2021, 13:16 - Théodore Bedos: But yeah that's soo dumb, he said that he would have not done it if he knew it was ours, but if it's not his it is certainly someone else's
23/09/2021, 13:16 - Gracou: Exactly
23/09/2021, 13:16 - Gracou: But he sounded like he felt rlly awful about it on the phone
23/09/2021, 13:16 - Gracou: He didn’t make any excuses and just said it was a really naive thing to do
23/09/2021, 13:44 - Théodore Bedos: I will feel less bad to ask him to help me tonight
23/09/2021, 13:45 - Théodore Bedos: I'm going to lunch at 2:00 if you are in town

13/10/2021, 18:50 - Gracou: Okay baby i think it would be bet he r to do the hello fresh before all of the rest of the ingredients go completely off as well x
13/10/2021, 19:00 - Théodore Bedos: They usually don't get off quickly, and we need to go get more meat, and more importantly do a lot of cleaning
13/10/2021, 19:00 - Gracou: Okay let’s order then
13/10/2021, 19:01 - Théodore Bedos: I am not against something not helathy

13/10/2021, 19:58 - Gracou: I want magu

15/10/2021, 10:53 - Théodore Bedos: Babe, you feeling ill is the opposite of an argument to make me come
15/10/2021, 10:53 - Gracou: Well I was coming to yours so it would save me the journey
15/10/2021, 10:56 - Théodore Bedos: You: Babe, I feel ill since a week, I am coughing, sneezing and I have headaches, and it starts to get even worst. Do you wanna come? Wait if you hesitate let me tell you that I really have a lot of microbe and that I gave my cough to 3 of my flatmate alreeady

15/10/2021, 11:04 - Théodore Bedos: I mean it depends what you mean by feeling even worst?? Because you say that but then you go to concerts and you're planning on organising a party so I don't know really how to interpret that
15/10/2021, 11:04 - Théodore Bedos: A flue last only 3/4 days max, you're telling me it's been a week

27/10/2021, 02:20 - Gracou: I’m really stressed babe I can’t sleep :( I have four deadlines from now until Thursday (3 of them are placement applications fyi)
27/10/2021, 08:02 - Théodore Bedos: Good morning baby 😘 Did you manage to find sleep?
27/10/2021, 08:03 - Théodore Bedos: Why did you go to the wine society until 2am if you have 4 deadlines?
27/10/2021, 08:03 - Gracou: I managed to get to sleep eventually but not a very deep one x
27/10/2021, 08:04 - Gracou: I didn’t go to wine society until 2 am darling I was just too stressed and couldn’t settle to sleep
27/10/2021, 08:08 - Théodore Bedos: You are awake?? Go back to sleep you need more
27/10/2021, 08:08 - Gracou: I have a lecture x
27/10/2021, 08:10 - Théodore Bedos: Even if it doesn't finish at 2am, why going to the wine society if you have 4 deadlines. You can go there every week, the deadlines are more important.
27/10/2021, 08:11 - Théodore Bedos: But come in you can do them today, just go straight to the library put your phone in plane mode and nail them
27/10/2021, 08:12 - Gracou: I know I’m not going to go every week
27/10/2021, 08:13 - Théodore Bedos: And don't even think of cancelling with me tonight to do them because you are going to push back your work. Set yourself 4 deadlines. The last one at 7pm that makes 2h per deadlines plus 1h for lunch if you start at 10am.
27/10/2021, 08:14 - Théodore Bedos: You can do that, I believe in you
27/10/2021, 08:14 - Gracou: I am in lectures until 11, and have a meeting this afternoon :/
27/10/2021, 08:14 - Gracou: But I don’t want to cancel on you babe
27/10/2021, 08:24 - Théodore Bedos: Set your last deadline to 8pm then and take less time to lunch. You can do it
27/10/2021, 09:13 - Théodore Bedos: https://youtu.be/Ad3cGfLC5v8
27/10/2021, 09:13 - Théodore Bedos: wtf...

03/11/2021, 18:43 - Gracou: Oh
03/11/2021, 18:44 - Gracou: Why not type ‘sorry I didn’t pick up ur call babe im at the gym’ in the first place😂
03/11/2021, 18:44 - Gracou: That’s a lot more useful
03/11/2021, 18:46 - Théodore Bedos: Because the first one I didn't refused it, I just missed it
03/11/2021, 18:46 - Gracou: Still

03/11/2021, 20:03 - Théodore Bedos: I am really bad at working in the evening
03/11/2021, 20:03 - Théodore Bedos: I don't have much time in the day

04/11/2021, 09:33 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
04/11/2021, 09:33 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf???
04/11/2021, 12:00 - Gracou: Hmm?
04/11/2021, 13:06 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
04/11/2021, 13:06 - Gracou: Do u prefer the leather or the suede
04/11/2021, 13:15 - Théodore Bedos: It's tough, I would normally say leather but I actually really like the suede on this model
04/11/2021, 13:16 - Théodore Bedos: But on the other side, you live in the UK and you'd rather have leather for a daily pair of boots as it resist better to the rain and it is more durable
04/11/2021, 13:16 - Théodore Bedos: Like if you had another pair I would say suede but because you don't probably leather
04/11/2021, 14:21 - Gracou: Hmm yes
04/11/2021, 16:56 - Gracou: What are you up to?
04/11/2021, 17:03 - Théodore Bedos: I am on campus
04/11/2021, 17:04 - Gracou: What were u thinking for this evening?
04/11/2021, 17:04 - Théodore Bedos: I was gonna survey people with cars about our business idea
04/11/2021, 17:04 - Gracou: Oh were u not planning on coming over for dinner?
04/11/2021, 17:05 - Théodore Bedos: I am not gonna ask people for 4h
04/11/2021, 17:05 - Théodore Bedos: But I was thinking about going gymming maybe
04/11/2021, 17:05 - Gracou: Okay i just finished lunch pretty much haha so
04/11/2021, 17:05 - Gracou: Oh so are u wanting to stay over at mine?
04/11/2021, 17:06 - Gracou: I thought u would pop over for a bit then go back to yours
04/11/2021, 17:06 - Théodore Bedos: No I can't stay at yours, I have work at 8 tommorow and I need to have a lot of stuff because I go straight to uni
04/11/2021, 17:06 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe, let me think
04/11/2021, 17:07 - Théodore Bedos: Are you free? I thought you were preparing your interview
04/11/2021, 17:13 - Gracou: To be honest I’m on the fence
04/11/2021, 17:14 - Gracou: Im missing you and have found it hard to concentrate today and haven’t been sure how to prep properly so thought it would be nice if u could come over for dinner and cuddles and then I can do a bit of prep before I go to sleep
04/11/2021, 17:14 - Gracou: So it would be better if u came earlier - but I sort of just finished lunch so
04/11/2021, 17:24 - Théodore Bedos: Lunchhhh!!!!
04/11/2021, 17:24 - Gracou: I know

05/11/2021, 14:37 - Théodore Bedos: You are fire babe
05/11/2021, 14:47 - Gracou: They told me about an hour after when they had finished the interviews :D
05/11/2021, 14:53 - Théodore Bedos: Easy to choose for them
05/11/2021, 14:54 - Théodore Bedos: So what is the name of the company, where is it exactly and how much do they pay you?
05/11/2021, 15:05 - Théodore Bedos: When do you start? Did you accept it?
05/11/2021, 15:11 - Gracou: Yes we have to accept the first offer we are given haha
05/11/2021, 15:12 - Gracou: I think it’s 22k and probably feb :) but I haven’t received the contract yet so it isn’t formalised
05/11/2021, 16:20 - Théodore Bedos: Where is it in London?
05/11/2021, 16:20 - Théodore Bedos: Are you happy to do that?
05/11/2021, 18:24 - Gracou: Yes I think it’s going to be a good placement
05/11/2021, 18:24 - Gracou: It’s kind of near Westminster
05/11/2021, 18:49 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
05/11/2021, 20:47 - Théodore Bedos: Is it a nice place of London?
05/11/2021, 21:32 - Gracou: I think so I’m not that familiar but Westminster is nice
05/11/2021, 21:33 - Gracou: When are u coming here?
05/11/2021, 22:01 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe 22h45
05/11/2021, 22:04 - Gracou: Okay
05/11/2021, 22:04 - Gracou: How come?
05/11/2021, 22:19 - Théodore Bedos: I had training until 8, came back at 9, just finished cooking and having dinner, I need to rest just a sec, I am exhausted
05/11/2021, 22:43 - Gracou: Okay
06/11/2021, 15:21 - Gracou: What time would u like me to come over?
06/11/2021, 15:52 - Théodore Bedos: I'll be leaving the gym at 6, you could meet me in front of the Odeon at 6?
06/11/2021, 16:04 - Gracou: That could work
06/11/2021, 16:25 - Théodore Bedos: My phone has 6 % batterie, I'll try to save it but when I leave at 6, I'll probably have no batterie
06/11/2021, 16:25 - Gracou: Okay it’s probably better if I just come to yours then x
06/11/2021, 16:25 - Théodore Bedos: So if you are not here I'll go directly home, and you can meet me there
06/11/2021, 16:26 - Théodore Bedos: But try to be here at 6 that would be nice
06/11/2021, 16:41 - Gracou: Okay
06/11/2021, 17:49 - Théodore Bedos: I forgot that I need to shower quickly, I'll be there at 18:05/10
06/11/2021, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
06/11/2021, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: Look what I got you this morning!!
06/11/2021, 18:26 - Théodore Bedos: And you dare to tell me that kind of thing on my binding when you make no fucking efforts to help me
06/11/2021, 18:28 - Théodore Bedos: Every time I come you room is a mess full of snack absolutely everywhere, and you dare to reproach me to have eaten half a box of those chocolate??????
Because that's what I had in the whole last week, half a box of that and half a bag of mnms.
06/11/2021, 18:29 - Théodore Bedos: Seriously, how can you reproach me that when you know that this is something that pains me everyday, and when you are not making any effort to help me with it.
06/11/2021, 18:30 - Théodore Bedos: On my side, I bought you two box of those yesterday and I kept them knowing that it would be a nightmare not to eat them.
06/11/2021, 18:31 - Théodore Bedos: And you how me a 100£ of hello fresh, so really I don't understand how you can blame me for half a box of chocolate roll
06/11/2021, 18:32 - Théodore Bedos: Really you've been a step to far
06/11/2021, 18:50 - Gracou: How dare you tell me to go home as I’ve just spent 15 minutes stood waiting for you. How can you complain that I’m not helping your disorder when I was literally buying BANANAS for breakfast bc I can’t have my cereal at your house because you eat all of it.
06/11/2021, 18:50 - Gracou: You know my rooms a mess because I have been fricking stressed Theodore and dealing with my anxiety and I don’t fricking accuse u if not supporting me like ur so quick to do whenever u get upset.
06/11/2021, 18:50 - Gracou: And u don’t think it’s rational that after u complain at me constantly for bringing food you can’t resist eating into your house that I don’t want to buy magnums you’re going to binge on? When you have proved you eat not only every snack in sight but also the ones that have been hidden. Wtf.
06/11/2021, 18:51 - Gracou: If u wanted to buy the magnums for me after u literally heard me say that I thought it would be nice to have them and u admitted to me that u know I always want them after dinner I don’t know what more affirmation you needed. It’s your house and you have an eating problem so I’m not making u bring the magnums into your house I told you it was your decision. And you were asking me about it when I was IN LINE so of course when we finished talking (and we had already held up the line) I’m going to go pay for my stuff because you don’t need to be babysat to pick up magnums.
06/11/2021, 18:51 - Gracou: Once again you have gotten defensive and pushed me away because you think it’s an easier way to handle your emotions. I’m so upset that you would go to that extent over fucking ice cream.
06/11/2021, 18:59 - Théodore Bedos: What did I do not support you this week? Can you tell me because I am not sure if going to your house 4 time in a week , saying nothing when you cancell on me or when I don't see you 4 times in a row is not supporting now??
06/11/2021, 18:59 - Gracou: I was literally just saying that I don’t accuse u when I’m upset bc that’s what you do.
06/11/2021, 19:00 - Gracou: And ask urself theo how many times I have been to your house 4 times in a week?
06/11/2021, 19:00 - Théodore Bedos: once
06/11/2021, 19:00 - Théodore Bedos: this year
06/11/2021, 19:01 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah but tell me when di I do something not to support you?
06/11/2021, 19:01 - Gracou: I literally didn’t complain at you for that theo. That’s literally what I said.
06/11/2021, 19:02 - Théodore Bedos: You didn't complained, because there was nothing for you to complain about!!!!
06/11/2021, 19:03 - Théodore Bedos: you are saying that you don't complain when I don't support you contrary to me, but please tell me when I did not support you
06/11/2021, 19:03 - Gracou: Don’t get me started on that Theodore you are saying things that will start argument
06/11/2021, 19:03 - Gracou: U need to take some space to think
06/11/2021, 19:04 - Théodore Bedos: I'd rather have you saying this instead of building some weird things in your mind and think that I am asking you if you want magnum so that I don't buy them
06/11/2021, 19:05 - Gracou: You’re the one building weird things in my mind
06/11/2021, 19:05 - Gracou: Your mind*
06/11/2021, 19:07 - Gracou: I don’t want to talk about this on a phone call we should have been discussing this in person
06/11/2021, 19:09 - Théodore Bedos: Yes we could have but instead of apologizing for the mean thing you said that you saw upset me a lot you'd rather take me to the word, stop and go home
06/11/2021, 19:09 - Gracou: You walked off and told me to go home
06/11/2021, 19:10 - Théodore Bedos: I said that if you came to tell me that kind of things you'd rather go home. You could have just apologise and we could have try to explain ourself
06/11/2021, 19:10 - Théodore Bedos: you decided to leave
06/11/2021, 19:11 - Théodore Bedos: You decide to leave which means that you prefere to insult me than to stay
06/11/2021, 19:11 - Gracou: No u said u don’t want to spend  time with me anymore and that I should go home
06/11/2021, 19:11 - Gracou: YOU WERE WALKING OFF
06/11/2021, 19:11 - Gracou: You were leaving whilst telling me to do the same
06/11/2021, 19:11 - Gracou: Which means you would rather turn you back on me than to stay
06/11/2021, 19:11 - Théodore Bedos: I litterally said: if you came to tell me this you'd rather go home
06/11/2021, 19:12 - Théodore Bedos: you decided not to follow me
06/11/2021, 19:12 - Théodore Bedos: i didn't leave, I kept walking in the same direction
06/11/2021, 19:12 - Gracou: What I heard was you telling me to go home while u sped up turned your body away from me and put distance in between us. That’s what happened.
06/11/2021, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: It's not
06/11/2021, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: and anyway you should never use one of my complex to prove your point
06/11/2021, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: I have never used anything like that to make a point
06/11/2021, 19:14 - Théodore Bedos: and you didn't mind using my binging
06/11/2021, 19:15 - Gracou: You were accusing me of not doing anything to help your binging and so yes, I will prove that I was trying to do something to help you’re binging. Since u can’t see it for yourself.
06/11/2021, 19:19 - Théodore Bedos: That's not true, stop rewriting the script. I just wanted to get you magnum and I don't know why you thaught that I was trying to make you buy me magnum. When obviously, I am not gonna expect you to buy the magnums if they stay at mine then. So I really don't know why you thaught that of me first. And then to explain yourself you said that I would bing anything and so I was trying to make you buy them so that I can bing them, wtfffffff?????
06/11/2021, 19:20 - Gracou: That’s not it at all
06/11/2021, 19:20 - Théodore Bedos: So call me to tell me
06/11/2021, 19:22 - Gracou: No I don’t want to be solving this problem on the phone.
06/11/2021, 19:22 - Théodore Bedos: That is so much easier than by text
06/11/2021, 19:23 - Gracou: I need to clear my head.
06/11/2021, 19:38 - Théodore Bedos: There is a Uber on the way to your house, please take it
06/11/2021, 19:39 - Gracou: Why couldn’t you come to mine?
06/11/2021, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know, we were going to mine so I didn't think more
06/11/2021, 19:40 - Gracou: Im really tired I don’t think I will be able to talk through this properly now
06/11/2021, 19:40 - Théodore Bedos: Also because we have 2 hello fresh to finish
06/11/2021, 19:40 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
06/11/2021, 19:41 - Théodore Bedos: If you change your mind
06/11/2021, 19:42 - Gracou: Im exhausted Theodore
06/11/2021, 19:47 - Gracou: The Uber isn’t here
06/11/2021, 19:47 - Théodore Bedos: I just cancelled it
06/11/2021, 19:47 - Gracou: Im stood on the fricking road
06/11/2021, 19:48 - Gracou: I will go back home
06/11/2021, 19:48 - Théodore Bedos: You told me that you were tired once, and then a second time, it couldn't be more clear .
I waited but the guy texted me to say that you were not here so I cancelled
06/11/2021, 19:48 - Théodore Bedos: But I can get you another one
06/11/2021, 19:49 - Gracou: I didnt tell u I wasn’t coming
06/11/2021, 19:49 - Gracou: U told me it would be there regardless
06/11/2021, 19:50 - Théodore Bedos: I know but just after that, you said again that you were exhausted
06/11/2021, 19:51 - Théodore Bedos: Do you want another one?
06/11/2021, 19:51 - Gracou: If you want me there. I’m waiting on the stair
06/11/2021, 19:54 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

08/11/2021, 09:55 - Gracou: Okay

08/11/2021, 10:31 - Gracou: It isn’t at ur door, but maybe it’s downstairs
08/11/2021, 10:39 - Théodore Bedos: Probably
08/11/2021, 10:56 - Gracou: Do u want me to put it in ur flat or can it stay downstairs?
08/11/2021, 12:46 - Gracou: Babe I’m rlly sorry my meeting is at 2, we normally meet at 4 so I thought I could come to volley ball :/
08/11/2021, 12:47 - Gracou: I will come to yours this evening to make up for it x we can play mind
08/11/2021, 13:09 - Théodore Bedos: Oh no
08/11/2021, 13:09 - Théodore Bedos: You said that you were in Holliday
08/11/2021, 13:10 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you have this to do
08/11/2021, 13:10 - Gracou: Yeah but we still do our coursework
08/11/2021, 13:10 - Gracou: Hmm?
08/11/2021, 13:10 - Théodore Bedos: Can you not just miss it once
08/11/2021, 13:10 - Gracou: No I can’t
08/11/2021, 13:10 - Gracou: It’s a group meeting?
08/11/2021, 13:10 - Gracou: Of course I can’t just go okay volleyball
08/11/2021, 13:10 - Gracou: I asked to move it but it’s not working
08/11/2021, 13:11 - Théodore Bedos: Why is it suddenly at 2?
08/11/2021, 13:11 - Théodore Bedos: Who decided
08/11/2021, 13:12 - Gracou: We decided last week
08/11/2021, 13:12 - Gracou: Apparently
08/11/2021, 13:12 - Gracou: But I thought it was at four but they say it was at 2
08/11/2021, 13:15 - Théodore Bedos: Do what you want
08/11/2021, 13:15 - Gracou: That is so passive aggressive
08/11/2021, 13:16 - Théodore Bedos: Of course, I am really annoyed.
08/11/2021, 13:17 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't trained this morning to play volleyball with you today, I cancelled Alex meeting today to have time
08/11/2021, 13:17 - Théodore Bedos: I left my lab in advance to have time to eat before
08/11/2021, 13:17 - Théodore Bedos: And mainly, I really wanted to play with you
08/11/2021, 13:17 - Gracou: I want to play too but I can’t just not go to this meeting
08/11/2021, 13:17 - Gracou: Ive tried to move it
08/11/2021, 13:19 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway, I don't think that it worth it for you to come tomorrow as I'll be working with James on our business until 8 and I'll go to bed early to wake up for training at 7
08/11/2021, 13:20 - Gracou: Okay
08/11/2021, 13:20 - Gracou: Im upset that u have gotten so angry at me
08/11/2021, 13:21 - Théodore Bedos: I am not angry at you, I am just very disappointed
08/11/2021, 13:21 - Théodore Bedos: And what I just said about tonight is not related at all
08/11/2021, 13:22 - Gracou: I understand why you’re disapointed I’m sorry for letting you down
08/11/2021, 13:22 - Gracou: Please believe me when I say I tried to do it another way
08/11/2021, 13:22 - Gracou: But there are 8 people so it’s just not easy to find another time
08/11/2021, 13:22 - Gracou: Which is why we decide a week in advance
08/11/2021, 13:23 - Théodore Bedos: I believe you
08/11/2021, 13:23 - Théodore Bedos: I am just sad
08/11/2021, 13:24 - Théodore Bedos: Can you not just say that you are ill
08/11/2021, 13:24 - Gracou: Im sorry
08/11/2021, 13:24 - Théodore Bedos: There are 8 persons, it's not the end of the world if one is missing
08/11/2021, 13:24 - Gracou: One is already missing
08/11/2021, 13:24 - Théodore Bedos: You see
08/11/2021, 13:24 - Gracou: And I’m the project manager, I lead the meetings and I make the decisions on what we do
08/11/2021, 13:25 - Gracou: Pretty much Nothing will happen if I don’t go
08/11/2021, 13:25 - Gracou: I really have to
08/11/2021, 16:47 - Gracou: I miss u I’m sad I wasn’t at volleyball
08/11/2021, 16:54 - Théodore Bedos: You know I said that it might not worth it for you to come tonight but if you want to you're always welcome
08/11/2021, 16:55 - Gracou: What time are you going to bed?
08/11/2021, 16:57 - Théodore Bedos: 10:30 max
08/11/2021, 17:11 - Gracou: Im a bit torn bc I will basically only see u for two hours, but at least I get to sleep next to you
08/11/2021, 17:11 - Gracou: But also I could try to get things sorted at home
08/11/2021, 17:13 - Théodore Bedos: We could get some noodle from Waitrose so that we don't have to cook
08/11/2021, 17:13 - Théodore Bedos: So we have more timz
08/11/2021, 17:14 - Gracou: Maybe
08/11/2021, 17:14 - Gracou: Give me a min I will try to decide
08/11/2021, 17:22 - Gracou: Baby I think I’m going to stay here
08/11/2021, 17:22 - Gracou: I have a lot of meetings and things tomorrow and I always use tonnes of time when I travel and pack and stuff and then I’m tired when I finally arrive so I just want to be able to start properly tomorrow evening
08/11/2021, 17:23 - Gracou: Tomorrow morning*
08/11/2021, 17:25 - Théodore Bedos: Sure, no problem
08/11/2021, 17:25 - Gracou: I will be really missing you tho😂
08/11/2021, 17:25 - Gracou: ❤️*
08/11/2021, 17:25 - Théodore Bedos: Me too
08/11/2021, 17:26 - Théodore Bedos: I went to the shops to make a double of the key, but he didn't want. He said that he is not allowed to make a double of the big key that opens the flat doors
08/11/2021, 17:27 - Théodore Bedos: I need the authorisation of a landlord, because it's a coproporety key
08/11/2021, 17:27 - Théodore Bedos: Coproprety
08/11/2021, 17:28 - Théodore Bedos: I can do doubles of my appartement keys, but it's a bit useless if you can't enter the flar
08/11/2021, 17:28 - Théodore Bedos: I would need to ask Tom if he is ok to let you one
08/11/2021, 17:37 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
08/11/2021, 17:37 - Théodore Bedos: Surprisingly in good shape after all the ice cream and rolls of yesterday
08/11/2021, 18:20 - Gracou: Would u mind asking him?
08/11/2021, 18:20 - Gracou: Ooo I like to see this
09/11/2021, 13:30 - Gracou: Btw I received the money from
Sézane and sent it to you
09/11/2021, 15:50 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you baby
09/11/2021, 15:50 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
09/11/2021, 15:51 - Théodore Bedos: Doesn't look too bad right?
09/11/2021, 15:54 - Gracou: No very good
09/11/2021, 15:54 - Gracou: Did u use canva?
09/11/2021, 15:55 - Gracou: Wanna go to cinema?
09/11/2021, 15:55 - Théodore Bedos: No I just use power point basically, ahaha
09/11/2021, 15:55 - Théodore Bedos: But I started by looking at canva
09/11/2021, 15:55 - Théodore Bedos: We might end up using it but it was easier to start like that
09/11/2021, 16:01 - Théodore Bedos: Could do but I need to save a bit of money to be honest, I checked my account yesterday and it was quiet mad
09/11/2021, 16:03 - Gracou: Probably don’t say ‘put me in your story’
09/11/2021, 16:04 - Théodore Bedos: What would you say?
09/11/2021, 16:04 - Gracou: Quiet mad?

09/11/2021, 16:06 - Gracou: Oh well when u say ‘me’ I don’t think of the car
09/11/2021, 16:07 - Théodore Bedos: We like me because it's like if the car was speaking

10/11/2021, 18:20 - Gracou: Wanna watch a movie? ;)
10/11/2021, 18:24 - Théodore Bedos: You don't understand the problem, I am in sportswear, I don't have cloth to get change, I don't have other underwear and I am sweaty from the gym, I don't think that I have my credit card, I don't have my computer, I don't have my charger for my phone that has 40%...
10/11/2021, 18:27 - Théodore Bedos: So no, I am asking if you want to meet me outside the gym so that we go get my key at Tivoli together and then go to my house because it is never there

10/11/2021, 19:02 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I had a shite day, and getting locked out doesn't help
10/11/2021, 19:02 - Théodore Bedos: That's why I'd like to see you, something is gonna go wrong if I stay alone

11/11/2021, 14:03 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
11/11/2021, 14:03 - Théodore Bedos: Looks like we missed a funny night
11/11/2021, 14:09 - Gracou: Haha I thought it would be really funny
11/11/2021, 14:10 - Gracou: The neighbour Alex says I’m pretty😇
11/11/2021, 14:10 - Théodore Bedos: Which neighbour?
11/11/2021, 14:11 - Gracou: The neighbour next door with the cars
11/11/2021, 14:11 - Gracou: The key for the big door broke when I used it so he came down to let me in
11/11/2021, 14:11 - Gracou: So we need to ask Tom for a new key
11/11/2021, 14:16 - Gracou: And apparently you’ve been having an Asian girl over so will be interesting to see what u have to say for that one
11/11/2021, 14:23 - Théodore Bedos: Whatttt????
11/11/2021, 14:24 - Théodore Bedos: Omg Grace, I told you to be careful with key!! We can't ask Tom to give us another one, it cost 60 pounds!!!
11/11/2021, 14:24 - Gracou: Theo I was careful with the key oh my gosh
11/11/2021, 14:24 - Gracou: It was literally so fragile
11/11/2021, 14:24 - Théodore Bedos: No you did not, I used the key yesterday and it was fine!
11/11/2021, 14:25 - Gracou: It just bent in there and I couldn’t open the door with it. It’s not safe to put in it might just completely Snap off in there
11/11/2021, 14:25 - Gracou: I DID.
11/11/2021, 14:25 - Théodore Bedos: So did you snap it or not???
11/11/2021, 14:25 - Gracou: No I didn’t snap it
11/11/2021, 14:26 - Théodore Bedos: So why did you say that it broke?
11/11/2021, 14:26 - Gracou: Bc it bent so much and the tear got bigger
11/11/2021, 14:26 - Théodore Bedos: Babe, you have to turn anticlockwise with that key!!!!!
11/11/2021, 14:27 - Théodore Bedos: It is inversed
11/11/2021, 14:27 - Théodore Bedos: Omg Grace
11/11/2021, 14:27 - Théodore Bedos: Of course it bends if you force the wrong way
11/11/2021, 14:34 - Théodore Bedos: Seriously I am really disappointed. Tom asked me to be careful with it, and I give my words that you would be.
11/11/2021, 15:32 - Gracou: I was careful with it theo but if you knew you had an anti-clockwise lock then I’m not sure why you didn’t tell me that when I had such a fragile key
11/11/2021, 15:32 - Gracou: Also my cousin asked this
11/11/2021, 15:32 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
11/11/2021, 15:32 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
11/11/2021, 17:04 - Gracou: Also, why does ur neighbour think uve been having an Asian girl over? U didn’t answer the first time I asked
11/11/2021, 17:05 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I said Whattt???
11/11/2021, 17:05 - Théodore Bedos: He probably think that it's victoria
11/11/2021, 17:05 - Gracou: I didn’t know that was to that
11/11/2021, 17:06 - Gracou: That’s what I thought but I explained Victoria and he was like no
11/11/2021, 17:06 - Gracou: And said it was a short girl
11/11/2021, 17:06 - Théodore Bedos: WTF!!!!
11/11/2021, 17:07 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe rbnb before I arrive??
11/11/2021, 17:07 - Théodore Bedos: Seriously no, the only 3 people that have been in this appartement since I am here are, Wiktoria, Alex and you
11/11/2021, 17:07 - Gracou: Maybe
11/11/2021, 17:08 - Gracou: Okay but u can’t blame me for asking
11/11/2021, 17:08 - Théodore Bedos: No of course it's fine
11/11/2021, 17:08 - Théodore Bedos: but I can blame you for destroying the key
11/11/2021, 17:08 - Théodore Bedos: seriously if you see it doesn't work on way try the other
11/11/2021, 17:08 - Gracou: Maybe Wu is real
11/11/2021, 17:09 - Gracou: I tried both ways darling
11/11/2021, 17:09 - Gracou: It just broke
11/11/2021, 17:09 - Théodore Bedos: I used it yesterday to open the door when we arrived Grace
11/11/2021, 17:09 - Gracou: I bent it one way when I tried it in one direction and the other way when I tried it the other direction
11/11/2021, 17:09 - Gracou: I wouldn’t destroy the key I’ve been begging u for on purpose
11/11/2021, 20:36 - Théodore Bedos: Did you arrive safely?
11/11/2021, 20:36 - Gracou: I did
11/11/2021, 20:36 - Gracou: I spent the evening with my grandparents and just got home
11/11/2021, 20:37 - Théodore Bedos: Nice
11/11/2021, 20:37 - Théodore Bedos: How is he going?
11/11/2021, 20:37 - Gracou: He had another operation yesterday so he is in pain
11/11/2021, 20:38 - Gracou: He has a big dent in his head from the first operation, and his ear is a bit smaller but doesn’t look deformed which I was a little surprised about
11/11/2021, 20:40 - Théodore Bedos: Why should his hear be smaller?
11/11/2021, 20:40 - Gracou: Because he had part of it removed bc there was a growth on it
11/11/2021, 20:41 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
11/11/2021, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: Ouille, that sounds awful
11/11/2021, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: I hope the next one's will be better
11/11/2021, 21:12 - Gracou: Yeah rlly horrible
11/11/2021, 21:12 - Gracou: I can’t believe they do it while he is awake
11/11/2021, 21:13 - Gracou: Obvi he is drugged but still
12/11/2021, 10:58 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

13/11/2021, 08:12 - Théodore Bedos: Me too babe, items just that I was in lecture and I continued with 2h of training, cooking and slipping

13/11/2021, 09:57 - Gracou: Okay babe
13/11/2021, 16:23 - Théodore Bedos: Why have you been up to today?
13/11/2021, 16:32 - Gracou: I went to exeter to pick up my ring that has been fixed
13/11/2021, 16:33 - Gracou: And I tried on an absolutely stunning stunning ring haha that has made me think maybe I would accept something other than the original ring I told u I wanted
13/11/2021, 16:37 - Gracou: What have you been up to?
13/11/2021, 17:20 - Gracou: Anyway to continue the point I was saying I realised how it was silly of me to say I so much wanted one ring when that isn’t what matters and I’m sorry for being ungrateful and I know you’re not offering it to me but that I would be honoured to wear manas ring x sorry for being silly and spoilt
13/11/2021, 17:21 - Gracou: So long as your sister doesn’t murder me

20/11/2021, 16:45 - Gracou: I need to come pick up my stuff from your house x are u at home?
20/11/2021, 17:13 - Théodore Bedos: No, I will be at 6:30
20/11/2021, 17:18 - Théodore Bedos: I am such in a shite situation, I texted COS that I found flights the 15th of December coming back the 29th. And Helen called me back annoyed, telling me that it was too long and that it was too short notice. I thought it was clear from the beginning that I would be out at Christmas but she said that since we haven't discussed about it since she put me on during Christmas
20/11/2021, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: So we discussed and she gave me until the 26th, I thanked her and I called my mum to be sure it was ok. And my mum told me that I needed to be in Paris min 1week after the operation for safety.
20/11/2021, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: And Helen didn't seem like she could let me have that
20/11/2021, 17:20 - Théodore Bedos: And on top of that I just realised that my parents are coming next weekend and I did not book a day off
20/11/2021, 17:21 - Théodore Bedos: And with the Christmas thing I am really not in the situation to ask a day off wit just a week of notice
20/11/2021, 17:21 - Théodore Bedos: I feel like my head is about to explode every second
20/11/2021, 17:23 - Gracou: Theo it’s urgent I’m at your door!
20/11/2021, 17:31 - Gracou: It’s okay Victoria let me in. Xxx
20/11/2021, 17:31 - Gracou: Whaaaat that’s so annoying
20/11/2021, 17:31 - Gracou: That’s so rude
20/11/2021, 17:40 - Gracou: What are u going to do?
20/11/2021, 17:40 - Gracou: Im sure u were clear about it from the begining as well
20/11/2021, 17:51 - Gracou: Oh no
20/11/2021, 17:51 - Gracou: Are u in cos rn?
20/11/2021, 17:52 - Théodore Bedos: No I am at the gym, I will be at cos tomorrow
20/11/2021, 17:53 - Gracou: Okay
20/11/2021, 17:53 - Gracou: I told u ages ago to book the day off!
20/11/2021, 17:54 - Gracou: U might have to say that u will quit if u can’t have the time off, and make it especially clear u need the time at Christmas to recover from an operation
20/11/2021, 18:03 - Gracou: Someone made show May https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8pP4Esw/
20/11/2021, 18:04 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I will have to but the thing it is not entireky their fault, I did forget to mention the operation and even if I thought it was clear I should have speaked about Christmas again.
So it's half my fault and I can't not be operated so in the end I'll have to clash with them and I really don't want because I really appreciate them. And I quite the job then I won't have money to come see you in London...
20/11/2021, 18:04 - Théodore Bedos: I feel so shite
20/11/2021, 18:10 - Théodore Bedos: How did your hunt go
20/11/2021, 18:11 - Gracou: That sucks :( they won’t want to fire you though darling they should have some flexibility when hiring students

20/11/2021, 19:06 - Gracou: I was literally just talking to her and she seemed fine!

20/11/2021, 21:30 - Théodore Bedos: We can discuss about later.
20/11/2021, 21:32 - Théodore Bedos: She said that when she see us cuddling like in the living room after our dinner yesterday, it gives her hope that it is possible to have someone who cares a lot for you and not just a 1 way relationship.
20/11/2021, 21:33 - Théodore Bedos: She also said that it always puts her in a good mood when she see our interactions in the kitchen. And that we really seem in love

12/12/2021, 13:42 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry I was extremely busy this morning
12/12/2021, 13:43 - Théodore Bedos: That's not very Christmassy to let them do, I thought you would all help each other cooking it
12/12/2021, 13:43 - Théodore Bedos: Do you know what they will cook? And how much I need to pay if I come
12/12/2021, 13:44 - Théodore Bedos: Also can you please tell me for sure if Chris will come or not
12/12/2021, 13:44 - Gracou: They think there isn’t enough room
12/12/2021, 13:45 - Gracou: They are cooking turkey, potatoes, sprouts, carrots, pigs in blankets, Yorkshire puddings and we have Yule logs. I think I am supposed to pay £10 I don’t think they will ask u go pay

12/12/2021, 14:54 - Théodore Bedos: WTF!!!! They start cooking at 3 to be ready at 7???
12/12/2021, 14:57 - Théodore Bedos: Are they killing the turkey themselves?
12/12/2021, 16:32 - Gracou: They say it’s bc it won’t all fit in the oven

16/12/2021, 17:57 - Gracou: Yes
16/12/2021, 17:58 - Théodore Bedos: By the way I passed all the control and I am in the queu for boarding
16/12/2021, 17:59 - Gracou: Super👌🏼
16/12/2021, 18:28 - Théodore Bedos: I am in the plane
16/12/2021, 18:33 - Théodore Bedos: I was at the duty free before and I remembered that I did not put any parfum on this morning so I thought I would take a spray of sauvage on me to see if my family notice something when I arrive. Because you know I wanted to wear a new parfum. So I looked all around to be sure no one see me and I do it quickly. 
I move to the side to check the prices, a guy cane just by me, grabe a bottle without even checking what it is and literally showered himself with it in front of everyone.
16/12/2021, 18:33 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf, who could ever think that it's a good idea to out 10 spray of parfum just before sitting tightly on a plane next to some other people
16/12/2021, 18:52 - Gracou: Hahaha
16/12/2021, 18:53 - Gracou: U take it very seriously
16/12/2021, 18:53 - Gracou: I would rather sit next to a man smelling of perfume than a stinky man
16/12/2021, 19:37 - Théodore Bedos: It didn't seem like a dirty man. He put it on and then he  pumped his chest like of he was such an alpha male after putting all the parfum
16/12/2021, 19:38 - Théodore Bedos: I really don't get it

17/12/2021, 01:35 - Gracou: Getting close to calling a pause on things
17/12/2021, 01:36 - Théodore Bedos: What do you mean by calling a pause?
17/12/2021, 01:36 - Théodore Bedos: Is she being annoying at the party?
17/12/2021, 07:45 - Gracou: I want my baby back x
17/12/2021, 07:45 - Gracou: Just being like I think we need space from each other
17/12/2021, 07:45 - Gracou: I had to walk her home
17/12/2021, 15:48 - Théodore Bedos: Was she annoying like last time when she was too drunk?
17/12/2021, 15:49 - Théodore Bedos: I miss you too baby
17/12/2021, 15:49 - Théodore Bedos: I saw the surgian and I might have to stay until the 3rd because he took Holliday untile the 2nd
17/12/2021, 15:49 - Gracou: No just complaining about the way I act then she got cramps so I walked her home
17/12/2021, 15:50 - Gracou: What do u mean he took holiday until the 2nd? Ur surgery is already booked?
17/12/2021, 15:50 - Théodore Bedos: But my dad call him pissed to say that we will go see another doctor after the operation so I might go back the 30th as planned
17/12/2021, 15:50 - Gracou: Okay
17/12/2021, 15:51 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I have the operation the 22 but I need to see him for a check after

18/12/2021, 18:35 - Gracou: Okay good I was worried it was today or something and I had forgotten
18/12/2021, 18:36 - Gracou: I was just being jokey baby
18/12/2021, 18:36 - Gracou: Did u literally ask the doctor ‘so I can’t fuck my girlfriend…. But can she still fuck me?’
18/12/2021, 22:19 - Théodore Bedos: He told me that I won't be able to do sport, I asked if sex was considered as sport. And he said that I can but only if I do nothing.
18/12/2021, 22:20 - Gracou: 😂😂😂😂

19/12/2021, 16:02 - Théodore Bedos: A raclette machine for two
19/12/2021, 16:02 - Gracou: 🤢
19/12/2021, 16:03 - Théodore Bedos: Nooo
19/12/2021, 16:03 - Gracou: So gross darling
19/12/2021, 16:03 - Théodore Bedos: 🤤

19/12/2021, 16:34 - Gracou: Awwww
19/12/2021, 16:34 - Gracou: Rachel ‘she’s very attractive’
19/12/2021, 19:38 - Théodore Bedos: I went to Uniqlo, OMG I love their new collection
19/12/2021, 19:38 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
19/12/2021, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
19/12/2021, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
19/12/2021, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: What do you think about the cardigan?
19/12/2021, 19:40 - Théodore Bedos: A d they had some new colour of the wool jumper that I have that are so good
19/12/2021, 19:40 - Théodore Bedos: What do you think about the grey wool trouser?
19/12/2021, 19:56 - Gracou: I like this outfit a lot
19/12/2021, 19:56 - Gracou: The wool trouser is cool
19/12/2021, 20:33 - Théodore Bedos: Cool right!!
19/12/2021, 20:34 - Théodore Bedos: Do you prefere the dark brown one or the camel one?  I quiet like the thin dark brown one under my jacket
19/12/2021, 20:36 - Théodore Bedos: The whole trouser is the new J+ collection of Uniqlo made by JW Anderson so it is surprisingly expensive for Uniqlo. I am gonna check how the one of sezanne looks like because they have a similar one.
19/12/2021, 20:36 - Théodore Bedos: By the way I have been to the sezanne shoppe today and it is incredible
19/12/2021, 20:44 - Gracou: No this is the one I like to be honest x
19/12/2021, 20:45 - Gracou: Really?! Would I like it?
19/12/2021, 21:54 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it is beautiful
19/12/2021, 21:54 - Théodore Bedos: Very big, with a lot of beautiful decoration, and massive fitting rooms with sofas
19/12/2021, 21:54 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
19/12/2021, 21:55 - Théodore Bedos: People were queuing in front
19/12/2021, 21:55 - Gracou: Wow
19/12/2021, 21:55 - Gracou: It looks really nice!
19/12/2021, 23:15 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my lovvvvvvvvveeeee😘😘😘😘
19/12/2021, 23:24 - Gracou: Good night my love ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I adore you
20/12/2021, 10:00 - Théodore Bedos: My dad just turned crazy, he just proposed to bring everyone to an outlet village outside Paris that we have been joking about since 10 years and said that everyone would have a 200euro budget.
20/12/2021, 10:01 - Théodore Bedos: On a Monday morning when he should be working...
20/12/2021, 10:06 - Théodore Bedos: 2 month ago he bought a new jean at Levi's and he wore it everyday. Today he puts it in the we wash. My guess is that because he just realised that he has nothing else to wear, he wants to go get a new one at the outlet village and not to show us that he wants to do shopping, he offers everyone to come do shopping to have a diversion
20/12/2021, 10:47 - Gracou: Hahahaha
20/12/2021, 10:48 - Gracou: Surely it would be a better idea to go to the outlet village by himself and buy some jeans tho that would mean no one noticed
20/12/2021, 10:59 - Gracou: Boobie I’m really missing you😔
20/12/2021, 11:26 - Gracou: Bea has covid! And wanna know how I found out? Not bc she sent me a message about it - bc she posted a picture on her story
20/12/2021, 11:28 - Gracou: I had a go at her and said wtf I’m with my family why wouldn’t u tell me - she goes oh it’s not likely to affect u and then says she sent a message on our house groupchat - and then I check the chat and all she has done is put the same picture of a test that’s on her story into the chat with absolutely no context as if it’s a fricking joke I’m not impressed
20/12/2021, 13:07 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf!!!! That is so iresponsible!!
20/12/2021, 13:07 - Théodore Bedos: I would be so pissed
20/12/2021, 13:09 - Gracou: Yeah
20/12/2021, 13:09 - Gracou: Luckily I’m negative
20/12/2021, 13:09 - Gracou: She literally acted like I was the dickhead for being mad at her
20/12/2021, 13:12 - Théodore Bedos: Not much surprised
20/12/2021, 13:12 - Gracou: My sister is telling me to cut bea and tom off completely
20/12/2021, 13:17 - Théodore Bedos: Not completely, you can still see them but I would stop to be the one proposing things
20/12/2021, 13:18 - Théodore Bedos: If you stop and they stop aswell then you were the only one holding this relationship. But if you stop and they propose you things to do then fine.
20/12/2021, 13:19 - Gracou: Well I’m living with bea in london so it isn’t rlly practical
20/12/2021, 13:19 - Gracou: Darcy said I shouldn’t be friends with someone that would shoulder me in the face and not appologise
20/12/2021, 13:19 - Gracou: I do agree
20/12/2021, 13:20 - Théodore Bedos: Definatly
20/12/2021, 13:22 - Théodore Bedos: But I think that the proximity makes it wiers for him to understand your relationship. It's easy to see people as siblings when you live too close. I am not sure it would have been the case if you would have not been living together and it would happened when you haven't seen him for a few week
20/12/2021, 13:24 - Théodore Bedos: Are you sure that you want to live with Bea next year. Did you not tell me that it was soo far from your job as well?
20/12/2021, 13:30 - Gracou: I don’t think it was him seeing me as a sibling tho I guess
20/12/2021, 13:30 - Gracou: No it’s relatively close for london
20/12/2021, 13:31 - Gracou: And I have no other option unless I want to live alone
20/12/2021, 15:02 - Théodore Bedos: Really can you not just ask you placement officer who else is going to London and make some more friends?
20/12/2021, 15:04 - Théodore Bedos: Because I won't be their in London so you won't have to possibility to spend time away from her if you are getting on each other nerves
20/12/2021, 15:57 - Gracou: No I did that last time and I hated it
20/12/2021, 17:17 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
20/12/2021, 17:18 - Théodore Bedos: There was a Uniqlo near the outlet store, I got myself this what do you think?
20/12/2021, 17:18 - Théodore Bedos: I think it's a killer with the green trouser
20/12/2021, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: They did not had any cardigan in this one 😢
20/12/2021, 17:24 - Gracou: It wouldn’t be my first choice of colour for you but it compliments the green trousers x
20/12/2021, 17:24 - Gracou: Yes bc the cardigan is the new collection x
20/12/2021, 17:27 - Gracou: Do u think there is a chance you will get stuck in France for a while?
20/12/2021, 17:27 - Gracou: Also what else did u get?
20/12/2021, 17:39 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
20/12/2021, 17:40 - Gracou: Did u end the call?
20/12/2021, 18:42 - Gracou: <Médias omis>

21/12/2021, 03:25 - Gracou: You stayed up very late!
21/12/2021, 04:14 - Gracou: Ugh babe I’ve been sleeping so terribly recently, I went to bed at 11 bc I was so tired from not being able to sleep until 5 yesterday and the day before but still getting up early ish and now I’ve woken up at 3 and can’t get back to sleep :/
21/12/2021, 04:19 - Gracou: Grrrrrrr it won’t let me return the Uniqlo trousers it says online they aren’t eligible :(
21/12/2021, 04:34 - Gracou: I have put the trousers on Depop hopfully someone will want them that’s so annoying bc it hasn’t been a month since I made the order :/ I should have been quicker tho to be fair but I think they purposely make it hard for you to return - they even make u pay to return!
21/12/2021, 09:02 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you think that your sleep is so bad. Are you going to bed at the same time recently?
21/12/2021, 09:03 - Théodore Bedos: Ho do you know the eligibility ? Which reason did they gave you
21/12/2021, 09:03 - Théodore Bedos: When I checked on the site it said 1 month.

02/01/2022, 18:56 - Théodore Bedos: don't worry I won't
02/01/2022, 18:56 - Gracou: Okay

02/01/2022, 23:53 - Théodore Bedos: I am quiet happy that they reintroduced king pin
02/01/2022, 23:54 - Théodore Bedos: He was the best antagonist they made in the marvel cinematic universe
02/01/2022, 23:55 - Théodore Bedos: (He was the bad guy in the 3 seasons of Daredevil, in case you don't know)
02/01/2022, 23:55 - Gracou: Oh really?

03/01/2022, 00:23 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
03/01/2022, 00:26 - Théodore Bedos: Just a feeling
03/01/2022, 00:42 - Gracou: Don’t worry baby sometimes my temper is short too though xxx I think it was because we didn’t really have time to relax, or work, or do an activity so we were constantly between things
03/01/2022, 00:43 - Gracou: And then having my parents around is like another pressure
03/01/2022, 00:43 - Gracou: But I really enjoyed spending that time with you xx
03/01/2022, 14:32 - Gracou: I love you darling❤️❤️❤️ I hope your day is going well
03/01/2022, 16:29 - Théodore Bedos: I think too

03/01/2022, 16:29 - Théodore Bedos: Me too, more than anything
03/01/2022, 16:30 - Théodore Bedos: It's alright, I have a business essay to write and I am a bit stupid not having it done before because I feel that you would be a great help
03/01/2022, 16:31 - Théodore Bedos: I have made my shopping, naught a lot of healthy food, made a plan and I am ready to perform
03/01/2022, 16:32 - Théodore Bedos: Also I would like a round of applause for Cos who become my official underwear supplier for 1s long as I have discounts
03/01/2022, 16:32 - Gracou: That my temper is short 😂
03/01/2022, 16:32 - Théodore Bedos: No the second part
03/01/2022, 16:32 - Gracou: I find it a pressure for my self a bit
03/01/2022, 16:32 - Gracou: X
03/01/2022, 16:32 - Gracou: Haha maybe I would have a few opinions - when is it due?
03/01/2022, 16:33 - Gracou: 👏👏👏👏👏👏
03/01/2022, 16:35 - Théodore Bedos: The 14th
03/01/2022, 16:36 - Théodore Bedos: There was a 30% discount so plus my 25% it went from 12 to 6,30. 
And 6,30 for a quality as good as the Uniqlo one and without the kangourou opening in front, I say........YES
03/01/2022, 17:42 - Gracou: Then I will have a look when I’m back in bath x
03/01/2022, 17:42 - Gracou: Oh that’s very good

03/01/2022, 18:00 - Gracou: Why are you swabbing
03/01/2022, 18:01 - Théodore Bedos: Because I need to do the day 2 test when entering the uk
03/01/2022, 18:01 - Théodore Bedos: It was supposed to arrive ta your house in Devon but it did not
03/01/2022, 18:01 - Gracou: Oh I thought you had already done that for some reason 😅

07/01/2022, 13:28 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
07/01/2022, 13:29 - Théodore Bedos: Look Emily's eyebrows are what makes her charm
07/01/2022, 13:29 - Théodore Bedos: No need to attack them
07/01/2022, 13:30 - Gracou: Babe her eyebrows are intensely shaped

07/01/2022, 17:37 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah I know I am so sorry, I was really hesitating but if I had go now, and then come back with you really I would have done no work of the day

07/01/2022, 17:38 - Théodore Bedos: very sorry
07/01/2022, 17:38 - Théodore Bedos: do you think I should have came? I thought you said that it was just fine because you wanted to spend time with your dad
07/01/2022, 17:39 - Gracou: It’s okay I understand xx
08/01/2022, 16:43 - Théodore Bedos: Omg, new season of attack on Titan starts tomorrow

08/01/2022, 18:09 - Gracou: I can’t wait
09/01/2022, 04:53 - Gracou: Literally just after one night I’ve been made to feel like I’m a bad person by joe and bea and I want to leave 😔 I don’t want to stay here but I don’t want to wake you up
09/01/2022, 04:53 - Gracou: I said one thing to bea to stand up for myself that she didn’t like then they literally run off upstairs
09/01/2022, 04:54 - Gracou: Someone here was trying to make me feel better by sending me a few messages and bea literally left because ot it
09/01/2022, 04:56 - Gracou: Then joe accused me of leaving stuff n the kitchen which just isn’t true bc I wash dry and put away everything every time And I told him that and he was still just completely adamant that yum stuff was there and wouldn’t just say sorry I just got it wrong
09/01/2022, 04:56 - Gracou: It’s hard to explain but it just makes me feel awful
09/01/2022, 07:00 - Théodore Bedos: I am sad for you baby, I just wanted you to realize that they were not acting like great but I never thought they would be dicks like that. I am very sorry that they make you feel like that. Off course you could have wake up for that.
09/01/2022, 07:02 - Théodore Bedos: Was before or after they left upstairs? Who was there in the house? Did Andy, Mike, Tom where not there to be nice?
09/01/2022, 07:03 - Théodore Bedos: Who tried to make you feel better and why not out loud instead of message. So if it is message how did Bea knew?
09/01/2022, 07:42 - Gracou: I’m literally still awake bc I was crying to Andy in the kitche
09/01/2022, 07:42 - Gracou: It’s so bad now I’m wasting a day :/
09/01/2022, 07:43 - Gracou: No no one said anything ur the only one that stands up for me
09/01/2022, 07:43 - Gracou: It was Sergios. I told him I didn’t want it to be a big deal which was why it was on
Message and then bea just reacted like that
09/01/2022, 07:45 - Gracou: I just told Andy that I basically feel so sad in this house and it makes me want to go to urs and then I feel villanised for being at yours by them
09/01/2022, 07:49 - Gracou: It’s going to be so much better when I’m with you next year
09/01/2022, 08:39 - Théodore Bedos: Oh nooo baby
09/01/2022, 08:40 - Théodore Bedos: Go to bed, you must be so tired and it must make you feel even worst
09/01/2022, 08:40 - Théodore Bedos: It's okay you don't have much to do today
09/01/2022, 08:44 - Théodore Bedos: Today at work at cos from 1 to 5:30, you can come at any time to get my keys
09/01/2022, 08:51 - Théodore Bedos: I love you baby, and I am sure that a lot of people are just waiting to appreciate you and see you as I do. Bea, Joe and Tom are not as you initially thought they were but it's okay, you have 80 years in front of you to meet other people, no one said that you have to meet your best friend  before 20. My dad met his best friend in Thailand 6/7 years ago. And my mum met two of her 3 best friend at work when she was around 25. Don't worry, the best is coming up for you
09/01/2022, 14:40 - Gracou: ❤️❤️❤️❤️
09/01/2022, 14:41 - Gracou: Thank you baby
09/01/2022, 15:58 - Gracou: Babe I might take a bath shall I do that at yours and then we can do the face masks from lush?
09/01/2022, 16:00 - Théodore Bedos: With pleasure babe, if that's what you need to relax ❤️
09/01/2022, 16:01 - Gracou: I could also do that here if u want to focus but thought it would be nice to do a mask together x
09/01/2022, 16:01 - Théodore Bedos: Good idea
09/01/2022, 16:02 - Théodore Bedos: Don't risk it at your house, if you do it their they gonna think that you use their bathroom or use too much water
09/01/2022, 16:03 - Théodore Bedos: Actually fuck them, you do what you want. But come here it will be nicer here
09/01/2022, 16:03 - Gracou: Hahaha i can’t tell if you’re joking or not
09/01/2022, 16:03 - Gracou: Okay baby x
09/01/2022, 16:27 - Théodore Bedos: It is so boring and quiet here
09/01/2022, 16:27 - Théodore Bedos: That's probably the most tiring
09/01/2022, 16:27 - Gracou: What’s most tiring?
09/01/2022, 16:28 - Théodore Bedos: When you have nothing to do
09/01/2022, 16:28 - Gracou: I had a migraine so I stayed in bed for a bit but now I’m packing so u will eu to get some packing done then come over to you❤️
09/01/2022, 17:04 - Gracou: Just went in the kitchen and bea was actually being very friendly with me
09/01/2022, 17:30 - Théodore Bedos: That's toxic people, one time nice, one time mean, so you think it's your fault or you pardon them and then you are sad again when they are mean again... You don't need that
09/01/2022, 17:34 - Gracou: I need to talk to her about it I just don’t want to do it now
09/01/2022, 18:22 - Gracou: Getting an Uber and coming now x
09/01/2022, 18:34 - Théodore Bedos: Nice!
09/01/2022, 21:28 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
10/01/2022, 13:54 - Gracou: Babe we could go to see dune on the 12th Jan
10/01/2022, 15:47 - Gracou: They gave me Moderna which is supposed to be the worst
10/01/2022, 15:47 - Gracou: They recommended I take paracetamol but not ibuprofen
10/01/2022, 16:00 - Théodore Bedos: Do what they say
11/01/2022, 17:12 - Théodore Bedos: Do you have dinner with me tonight or with your flatmate?
11/01/2022, 17:13 - Théodore Bedos: What about me grabbing you a MacDonald so that you have time to eat before you go?
11/01/2022, 17:45 - Théodore Bedos: ??
11/01/2022, 17:45 - Gracou: Sorry I didn’t see this!
11/01/2022, 17:45 - Gracou: I’ve decided to stay here tonight
11/01/2022, 17:48 - Gracou: I need some fresh air so might go to Waitrose to get dc - do u want me to wait and we can go together?
11/01/2022, 17:49 - Théodore Bedos: dc - do?
11/01/2022, 17:49 - Théodore Bedos: What is that?
11/01/2022, 17:51 - Théodore Bedos: Why did you decided to stay?
11/01/2022, 17:51 - Gracou: Diet Coke
11/01/2022, 17:51 - Gracou: Bc my flat mates seemed kinda meh
11/01/2022, 17:52 - Gracou: It felt like no one was that up for it and I don’t have tonnes of energy so I don’t wanna go over there and be forcing people to hang out when I can be here with you
12/01/2022, 18:01 - Gracou: I’m going to sleep at my house tonight x
12/01/2022, 18:05 - Théodore Bedos: Ok
12/01/2022, 20:37 - Théodore Bedos: Please come back at the house tonight, I have rewrote 200 times the same sentence, I am turning nuts
13/01/2022, 00:17 - Gracou: I love you so much❤️❤️❤️
13/01/2022, 00:36 - Théodore Bedos: Me too
13/01/2022, 00:37 - Gracou: You wouldn’t believe what I came back to the house to. I will tell you in the morning
13/01/2022, 00:38 - Théodore Bedos: Tell me
13/01/2022, 00:38 - Gracou: I can’t right now xxx u don’t need to worry I’m safe❤️
13/01/2022, 00:40 - Théodore Bedos: Tell meeeeeeeee
13/01/2022, 01:25 - Gracou: ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ don’t worry
13/01/2022, 12:04 - Gracou: Basically after the movie bea toby and I went for a drink and joe went home
13/01/2022, 12:05 - Gracou: Then Joe sent us a message saying tom had gotten angry and stormed off to his room bc we were ‘supposed’ to be doing secret Santa
13/01/2022, 12:07 - Gracou: But when we got that message I immediately just got scared that what happened the last time tom got angry would happen again and I was rlly freaked out. Bea knew right away that it was serious and offered to walk me to yours. I said no because I didn’t want to feel like I couldn’t return to my own house and toby was like ‘it’s okay we will be there for you the whole time’
13/01/2022, 12:07 - Gracou: So then we get home and Andy and joe make faces as if the whole thing is rlly awkward that tom has stormed off and I sit down and ask Andy what happened and then toby goes upstairs to speak to tom who is in his room
13/01/2022, 12:10 - Gracou: Toby comes back down saying ‘he really isn’t happy he just wants to be left alone for the night’ and then tom Jumps our of the door behind him pulling a funny face and apparently it was all just a prank. I went very quiet bc I was clearly very upset that they didn’t realise how that would make me feel. Especially Andy and joe who were there when the thing happened with tom and i sat with joe for ages after At the time etc. Toby starts making joes and just goes ‘Im off to bed’ after he said he would be there for me. Someone in the room says ‘grace u don’t look happy’ jokingly and I just said ‘no I’m not happy how could u not see how that would make me feel’
13/01/2022, 12:12 - Gracou: Basically bea stands up for me and said they shouldn’t have done it, joe and tom go to bed. I tell Andy off then I leave to pee and bea tells Andy off. Then I go to joes room and start crying and say that it rlly upset me then I go back downstairs and talk to Andy and then joe comes back down with a chocolate saying sorry but for some reason I forgive Andy but I can’t seem to completely forgive joe

28/01/2022, 13:17 - Théodore Bedos: I had so much hop for it
28/01/2022, 13:17 - Théodore Bedos: I was confident
28/01/2022, 13:18 - Théodore Bedos: They changed the format from pick 3 question on 5 to answer all 4. It was impossible to do 4 question in that few time. And it was just soo much harder than anything we did before
28/01/2022, 13:18 - Théodore Bedos: I did half of the thing, with butchered answer
28/01/2022, 15:26 - Gracou: That is mean of them

29/01/2022, 11:45 - Théodore Bedos: Alright I'll try to, but babe I don't really understand why you feel the need to blame me for something like that when you know that I am having such a rough time at the moment
29/01/2022, 18:31 - Gracou: Thanks for trying babe I’m sorry ur having a tough time but when u just say nothing to my messages a lot of the time it makes me not sure why I bother trying to make u feel better
29/01/2022, 21:54 - Gracou: Are you a little high baby
30/01/2022, 00:31 - Théodore Bedos: I just went back home

30/01/2022, 00:45 - Gracou: Im worried about you
30/01/2022, 01:14 - Théodore Bedos: No I did smoke, but just did very quickly, not much just before going. But it did nothing to me
30/01/2022, 01:16 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe I just didn't pull enough on it because it wasn't mine so I didn't wanted to take too much of it from them
30/01/2022, 01:16 - Théodore Bedos: We had a drink together after but the bar closed after our first drink so we ended here
30/01/2022, 01:39 - Gracou: I love you

05/02/2022, 08:00 - Théodore Bedos: You know the song, you're the inspiration. I use to listen to it thinking that I had soo much love to give in me but no one to declare it to as the guy in the song but that one day I'll meet my inspiration. And now every time I listen to it I'm in love with you a little more every time.

06/02/2022, 22:35 - Gracou: That isn’t very nice

06/02/2022, 22:40 - Théodore Bedos: Nice
06/02/2022, 22:41 - Gracou: I found it difficult to communicate how I felt
06/02/2022, 22:42 - Gracou: I am sorry
06/02/2022, 22:43 - Gracou: I just don’t appreciate you trying to tell me I’m wrong about drugs bc everyone else thinks it’s their job to convince me
06/02/2022, 22:44 - Gracou: I felt frustrated that you were discussing it with Victoria
06/02/2022, 22:46 - Gracou: and I was jealous of u having a good time with Victoria and it didn’t make me feel better that u were having a good time while disagreeing with me if u understand what I mean
06/02/2022, 22:48 - Gracou: I sort of would just prefer that if ur going to do that just say ‘yeah she is anti drugs’ but then not go on to have a long convo about why u disagree with me it doesn’t make me feel very nice
06/02/2022, 22:49 - Gracou: I don’t talk for a long period of time when people ask whether u do drugs about how I disagree with you I just say ‘yes he smokes weed but quite rarely’ and if people ask what I think I just say ‘he is smart and I trust him’
06/02/2022, 22:50 - Gracou: I feel like your answer about that should be more like that
06/02/2022, 22:50 - Gracou: We are a team
06/02/2022, 22:54 - Théodore Bedos: Where did you get that we talked about that for long? I told you that we talked about many things and among those, there was briefly this. 
There was no need for you to start whispering stuffs that you don't want to repeat
06/02/2022, 22:54 - Gracou: I whispered because everyone is listening
06/02/2022, 22:55 - Gracou: Bea listens to our arguments even in our last house
06/02/2022, 22:55 - Gracou: And mike is also trying to sleep
06/02/2022, 22:55 - Gracou: And no matter how long it was I still feel the same way about it
06/02/2022, 22:57 - Théodore Bedos: That's not true you were speaking louder when you wanted to, just for some stuff you whispered. If you can't talk just don't call me
06/02/2022, 22:58 - Gracou: I spoke louder when it was stuff that I was less bothered about the rest of my flat heating
06/02/2022, 22:58 - Gracou: I am trying to communicate right now so I don’t think it’s fair to complain about that
06/02/2022, 22:59 - Gracou: And I think that it’s mean of u to say not to call u I’m trying to make an effort
06/02/2022, 23:01 - Théodore Bedos: And we said absolutely nothing bad on you at all. She just said that she would let us do mdma, and I said that it was really not your style. She ask if even not weed. And then she said that she was surprised because to her alcohol is much worst because weed can be a medication whereas alcohol as only negative effect. That's it, why did you need to act like if we did something horrible.
06/02/2022, 23:02 - Théodore Bedos: Yes but that's to late you already pissed me
06/02/2022, 23:05 - Gracou: I’m really upset too
06/02/2022, 23:05 - Gracou: You were very quick to be pissed w me
06/02/2022, 23:15 - Théodore Bedos: You know what, yeah I probably get pissed quickly, and that's because I was already annoyed by the fact that I have been worrying all week if I would be able to make all my timetable fit into 5 days so that I can have my week end free to see you. I went twice on my days off to speak to Helen and sort this out. I emailed my academic supervisor to ask them precision about it so that I can make it work. I baught a railcard, I reserved a restaurant for valentine's Day. 
But you, it did not even cross your mind to come visit me this weekend. You went out 5 time in a row but you can't find 5 min to try to learn my language. When I am trying to find jobs in London to be closer to you.
06/02/2022, 23:17 - Théodore Bedos: So yes I am a bit upset when you call me and you can't even make the effort of speaking loud enough to have a conversation with me.
06/02/2022, 23:19 - Gracou: Theo I need to settle here it wouldn’t have been right for me to go to bath this weekend
06/02/2022, 23:20 - Gracou: I really appreciate all those efforts that you make for me
06/02/2022, 23:27 - Théodore Bedos: Very good way to settle that to go out, then spending the afternoon in spoons and trying to go out again after. 
If you really want to do something in life you can always find the time
06/02/2022, 23:28 - Théodore Bedos: But as I said it did not even cross your mind
06/02/2022, 23:30 - Gracou: Making friends and exploring the city is part of settling here!
06/02/2022, 23:30 - Gracou: That is exactly what I was aiming to do!
06/02/2022, 23:30 - Gracou: So that this can be like home and I can enjoy being here
06/02/2022, 23:30 - Gracou: It’s not about me just wanting to go out
06/02/2022, 23:36 - Gracou: Why does it make such a big deal for you about doing a french app every day
07/02/2022, 07:42 - Théodore Bedos: I am disappointed of you asking that
07/02/2022, 07:43 - Gracou: It’s just you have been more bothered by it lately than normal
07/02/2022, 07:49 - Théodore Bedos: Because it will be soon a year that we are together and I thought/hoped you would do a lot better at it than now after a year. Maybe also because you haven't done it at all in 3 weeks. And it shows me that if I am not here to push you doing it you don't really seem to care about learning my language
07/02/2022, 07:50 - Gracou: That isn’t true
07/02/2022, 08:21 - Gracou: Theo there are so many things that I haven’t been doing because I just have been too exhausted or would have had to miss out on experiencing things I’m supposed to experience it isn’t just french
07/02/2022, 12:15 - Théodore Bedos: Makes me feel like I am just the least of your priority
07/02/2022, 18:22 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
07/02/2022, 18:27 - Gracou: I tried to call u back
07/02/2022, 18:28 - Théodore Bedos: Me too
07/02/2022, 18:32 - Théodore Bedos: Ok I have tried to call you 5 time, I give up
07/02/2022, 18:41 - Théodore Bedos: Why are you not trying to call me?
07/02/2022, 18:48 - Gracou: When you didn’t answer I called my grandfather and now I’m on the tube
07/02/2022, 18:49 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to volleyball in 15min, if I don't answer it's because I am there
07/02/2022, 18:54 - Gracou: I will call u when I’m off
07/02/2022, 18:54 - Gracou: Okay
07/02/2022, 18:56 - Théodore Bedos: I will probably not see it Grace. I am going to volleyball now
07/02/2022, 19:35 - Gracou: Only just got home
07/02/2022, 19:35 - Gracou: Call me when ur back from volleyball if u want
07/02/2022, 22:14 - Gracou: I’ve been really sad about the way things are right now :(
07/02/2022, 22:43 - Gracou: Theo?
07/02/2022, 22:51 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
07/02/2022, 22:59 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry I am in the queue of the fucking bus with all the drunk retarded waste and there has been 5 bus passing in front of me because no one respect that fucking queue
07/02/2022, 22:59 - Théodore Bedos: That's been 1h that I am in
07/02/2022, 22:59 - Théodore Bedos: And it's so tight that I could not even reach my phone
07/02/2022, 23:03 - Théodore Bedos: I am finally in
07/02/2022, 23:04 - Gracou: Oh my gosh baby
07/02/2022, 23:04 - Gracou: Why didn’t you get an uber? Or walk?
07/02/2022, 23:05 - Gracou: I’m about to hop in the shower so might not reply for a few minutes
07/02/2022, 23:06 - Théodore Bedos: The queue was short but then they all arrived at once, and sneaked from every side. Then I was stuck in the middle and I didn't wanted to be a dick as them all so I didn't push anyone
07/02/2022, 23:06 - Gracou: :(
07/02/2022, 23:06 - Gracou: You must have been cold
07/02/2022, 23:07 - Théodore Bedos: But I told one dude I would break his nose in front of everyone if he pushed me again
07/02/2022, 23:07 - Gracou: Hahahhaha
07/02/2022, 23:07 - Gracou: Did he push
07/02/2022, 23:07 - Théodore Bedos: So this dick went all the way around to avoid me
07/02/2022, 23:08 - Gracou: And u broke his nose?
07/02/2022, 23:11 - Théodore Bedos: No he went all the way around, and when I was close to him again I was not gonna head butt him 10 min later when no one around remember why
07/02/2022, 23:12 - Théodore Bedos: I wish I grabbed his phone and thrown it over the bus
07/02/2022, 23:12 - Théodore Bedos: I did too much meditation, that's not like me
07/02/2022, 23:22 - Gracou: Hahaha
07/02/2022, 23:23 - Gracou: No baby I prefer peaceful theo
07/02/2022, 23:31 - Gracou: That might have ruined our vday activities
07/02/2022, 23:31 - Gracou: Sex
07/02/2022, 23:35 - Gracou: I really just don’t feel like I’m able to talk without being listened to
07/02/2022, 23:35 - Gracou: It isn’t a very nice feeling
07/02/2022, 23:36 - Gracou: I’ve heard them talking in the kitchen about what I say on the phone
07/02/2022, 23:36 - Gracou: And bea always brings up arguments I have with u later
07/02/2022, 23:36 - Gracou: So I don’t want her to hear and think we are arguing
07/02/2022, 23:47 - Gracou: You are listening to what I’m saying to you or trying to compromise at all
07/02/2022, 23:47 - Gracou: Arent*
07/02/2022, 23:50 - Théodore Bedos: Yesterday when I took on me and said, "I am sorry that you took it bad" you shitted on my apologies
07/02/2022, 23:51 - Théodore Bedos: So I just want excuses
07/02/2022, 23:53 - Théodore Bedos: Excuses because there was no reason to get pissed about me and Wiktoria having a chat when literally precised in my sentence that we talked about many things and one of those was that.
07/02/2022, 23:54 - Théodore Bedos: Excuses because I am pissed to be the least of your priorities.
07/02/2022, 23:55 - Théodore Bedos: To the point that you prefer to talk to stranger during a 50min train rather than doing 5/10 min of learning my language
08/02/2022, 00:02 - Théodore Bedos: And I fucking have no one around me to make me forgot about that, that's unfair to let me like this. It's gonna make me restart binging
08/02/2022, 00:35 - Théodore Bedos: I really don't want to stay pissed at you baby , I love you soo much but why can't you see why it pisses me that you can't spend 5 min on french for me
08/02/2022, 08:39 - Gracou: Theo just letting you know I’m not ignoring you I’m just not able to address this problem properly right now
08/02/2022, 08:39 - Gracou: I love you so much too
08/02/2022, 11:05 - Théodore Bedos: Just spend 30 min at the bus stop to go on campus because they changed the bus stop location and 4 buses did not even 0ass in front of it. 
So people started crowding and I recognized my lecturer, arriving after everyone and fucking skipping the queue in front of everyone when the bus arrived!!!
08/02/2022, 11:05 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf!!
08/02/2022, 12:24 - Gracou: Whaaaat where is the bus stop location?
08/02/2022, 12:25 - Gracou: Omg rude
08/02/2022, 21:04 - Gracou: I’m going to have dinner then call you
08/02/2022, 21:10 - Théodore Bedos: I just came back from the gym and finished diner, you can call me when you can
08/02/2022, 21:12 - Gracou: Okay
09/02/2022, 12:15 - Gracou: Wanna see my new passport photo? Bea took it
09/02/2022, 12:16 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/02/2022, 12:29 - Théodore Bedos: It's a good picture
09/02/2022, 12:29 - Théodore Bedos: Don't worry
09/02/2022, 12:29 - Gracou: Thanks babe
09/02/2022, 12:43 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/02/2022, 12:43 - Gracou: What is iel
09/02/2022, 13:18 - Théodore Bedos: It's a mix of Il and Elle, that means she consider herself as non gender
09/02/2022, 15:01 - Gracou: I thought so
09/02/2022, 15:01 - Gracou: How is it pronounced
09/02/2022, 15:08 - Théodore Bedos: I would say "yel"
09/02/2022, 15:48 - Gracou: Thanks babe
09/02/2022, 16:39 - Théodore Bedos: Please so the 16 personalities test
09/02/2022, 16:40 - Gracou: Hmm?
09/02/2022, 16:41 - Théodore Bedos: Try it please
09/02/2022, 16:41 - Gracou: I can’t at work obvi
09/02/2022, 16:42 - Théodore Bedos: Laurence at work asked me to do it
I was a bit reluctant
I did it and the profile it found for me is so right, it is a little scary
09/02/2022, 16:44 - Théodore Bedos: If I was trying to describe my mind, I couldn't be any close to as accurate as the description is
09/02/2022, 16:49 - Théodore Bedos: I would like to read your profile when you would have done and you to read mine. I think it would be a great tool to understand eachother even better
09/02/2022, 16:52 - Gracou: I haven’t read it but here it is. I did it in 1st year and it’s changed since then.
https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality
09/02/2022, 17:05 - Théodore Bedos: Alright I'll read it
09/02/2022, 17:06 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you think it would have changed?
09/02/2022, 17:18 - Gracou: I’m not sure
09/02/2022, 17:18 - Gracou: Actually I looked a bit and it still says I’m mainly a leader so that’s the same
09/02/2022, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: What do you mean you looked a bit
09/02/2022, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: Just take the test again
09/02/2022, 17:19 - Gracou: I think my perspectives on certain things are a little different
09/02/2022, 17:19 - Gracou: I was probably a protagonist
09/02/2022, 17:19 - Gracou: Read a bit
09/02/2022, 17:19 - Gracou: Theo that defeats the point
09/02/2022, 17:20 - Théodore Bedos: What do you mean?
09/02/2022, 17:20 - Gracou: You’re supposed to answer without overthinking
09/02/2022, 17:20 - Théodore Bedos: I am at work
09/02/2022, 17:20 - Gracou: Oh
09/02/2022, 17:20 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, but so why did you say that it has changed
09/02/2022, 17:30 - Gracou: Bc I thought it had when I first saw it
09/02/2022, 20:20 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
09/02/2022, 20:20 - Théodore Bedos: Can you believe that this is what I go for secret Santa?
09/02/2022, 20:20 - Gracou: What on earth babe
09/02/2022, 20:20 - Gracou: That is the worst secret Santa gift
09/02/2022, 20:21 - Gracou: At least you still look good in it
09/02/2022, 20:21 - Théodore Bedos: In competition with the bike bell I got the last time I did secret Santa
09/02/2022, 20:21 - Théodore Bedos: I have a malediction
09/02/2022, 20:22 - Gracou: Nobody is very good at getting you gifts
09/02/2022, 20:22 - Théodore Bedos: I gave my gift to Ezzi at the same time. And he was so happy with it
09/02/2022, 20:23 - Théodore Bedos: He was laughing a lot because of me getting him, Cos underwear + lifting straps when I got this
09/02/2022, 20:28 - Théodore Bedos: Today the team won against Bristol which means that we won the league. So I got a big pack of 15 beers for all the team, and went to the pres. But just one guy of the Team went, because it was apparently a pre pres. There was only the women 1st team. So my gift flopped
09/02/2022, 20:29 - Théodore Bedos: I gave it to Fred who was there because I am not going to the main près because it's on campus and I have Ork tommorow
09/02/2022, 21:47 - Gracou: Love u x sorry will answer later x
10/02/2022, 00:06 - Gracou: I’m so happy ezi loved it gift! U put a lot of thought into it x

16/02/2022, 18:33 - Théodore Bedos: I don't get why you keep saying that Birmingham is clother to London than to Bath
16/02/2022, 18:33 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/02/2022, 18:33 - Théodore Bedos: Clearly I was right
16/02/2022, 18:33 - Théodore Bedos: It's clother to Bath
16/02/2022, 18:33 - Gracou: I just meant it was north of bath
16/02/2022, 18:34 - Gracou: And north of london
16/02/2022, 18:34 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
16/02/2022, 18:35 - Théodore Bedos: No you told me a few time that it was faster to go to Birmingham from London than to Bath.
Like when you said that Darcy was going to Devon by passing through London or when I said that you could join me in Bath before going to Birmingham for the plane
16/02/2022, 18:36 - Théodore Bedos: And you said that it was so silly because London is much closer to Birmingham than Bath is
16/02/2022, 19:04 - Gracou: I don’t understand what your on about
16/02/2022, 19:09 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

16/02/2022, 19:41 - Théodore Bedos: I don't care that much. I just saw the map and I remembered that
16/02/2022, 19:41 - Gracou: Okay my love.

21/02/2022, 21:52 - Théodore Bedos: You seem to have had a busy day
21/02/2022, 22:16 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
21/02/2022, 22:17 - Gracou: You don’t pick up my call?
22/02/2022, 01:04 - Gracou: Theo my love I tried to call you because I just can’t bear to not be honest with you and I can’t believe I said what I did and said I was at work drinks. I felt awful all day at work and I agreed to meet Isaac after work bc he asked to talk about what happened the other night and it was just so awkward at work that I felt the need to tell him for sure he didn’t have a chance and I made sure to tell him lots of times I would just never ever be interested. But I messed up and I stayed too long in the conversation and it turned from him saying how sorry he was to him turning back to saying these nice things about me. I don’t know why but there was just some part of me that wanted to hear it and I just kept listening and it made me feel like I was this cool person that you make me feel like I am every single day so I shouldn’t have listened to it.

We never touched and I never said anything like he was saying back to him but I just think I shouldn’t have even listened in the first place and I feel so guilty for listening to it and talking to him. And even as he was saying what he would say I would say I just adored you and how good you were to me and how you make me feel. He just has absolutely nothing on you. But I just don’t know why, I’m so sorry I just liked hearing that someone liked me. But there is just no one that matters to me more than you theo.

I have blocked him on everything because you are the only one that I want and the only one that I need to make me feel wanted I was just so so stupid and I am so so so so sorry theo. And I tried to call you because I want you to hear me with my voice but I can’t bare to go to sleep after not telling the truth to you like that.

I have never lied to you before and I will never lie to you again I’m so so so so sorry theo you are the light in my life and my rock and I would never pursue anything with anyone other than you and I shouldn’t have been so stupid as to listen and stay for so long I am so so so sorry and I will do whatever I can to make it up to you because I will never ever betray you or my love for you but I shouldn’t have done what I did nonetheless.

I never want to break my trust with you which is why I want to tell you this right away. Absolutely nothing happened and I will never sit and listen to anything like that ever again.

I love you more than anything else in the world and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
22/02/2022, 01:09 - Gracou: I am so sorry to leave you such a horrible message to wake up to I just really can’t even take one night of not telling you the truth
22/02/2022, 01:11 - Gracou: Theo you’re the one that is everything I want And I need 💕❤️❤️❤️❤️ I will do whatever I takes to make it up to you
22/02/2022, 00:35 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué

22/02/2022, 14:23 - Gracou: Why do you ask?
22/02/2022, 14:23 - Théodore Bedos: Curiosity
22/02/2022, 14:23 - Théodore Bedos: I wanted to see where it was in the station
22/02/2022, 14:26 - Gracou: Queen Victoria 😘
22/02/2022, 15:20 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you
22/02/2022, 15:22 - Théodore Bedos: There is no Queen Victoria hotel in Avoriaz
22/02/2022, 15:22 - Théodore Bedos: Is that a ref from the Shaq video?
22/02/2022, 15:23 - Gracou: Yes
22/02/2022, 15:23 - Gracou: My mum hasn’t answered yet
22/02/2022, 15:23 - Théodore Bedos: Did you found it funny?
22/02/2022, 15:23 - Gracou: I was offended he didn’t know the name of our queen
22/02/2022, 15:24 - Théodore Bedos: It's Shaq you need to be tolerant
22/02/2022, 15:24 - Gracou: I know
22/02/2022, 15:25 - Gracou: I’m stressed I feel like I’m not doing a very good job at my job :(
22/02/2022, 15:25 - Théodore Bedos: Whatttt? Why???
22/02/2022, 15:26 - Gracou: I just feel like I’m not succeeding very well
22/02/2022, 15:26 - Gracou: And it’s called Electra
22/02/2022, 15:27 - Théodore Bedos: In which way?
22/02/2022, 15:27 - Théodore Bedos: What's wrong?
22/02/2022, 15:27 - Gracou: Elektra*
22/02/2022, 15:33 - Gracou: Well I just had a meeting with my boss and I just felt that I didn’t have much to say that I had achieved
22/02/2022, 15:33 - Gracou: Sorry had to take a work call part way through typing
22/02/2022, 15:34 - Gracou: And then now someone just sent me an email being like ‘we should have had this delivery of 40,000 inserts last week and it’s not here’ and I didn’t even know I had to make the order so I just feel a bit stuck
22/02/2022, 15:35 - Théodore Bedos: Ask them to write it down in an email next time they ask you something important like that
22/02/2022, 15:36 - Théodore Bedos: Do you mean, that you haven't found many influencers?
22/02/2022, 15:36 - Théodore Bedos: Why don't you ask Elena?
22/02/2022, 15:36 - Théodore Bedos: She can maybe even give you tips on how to convince influencers. Maybe give you influencers she knows would be interested or good fit
22/02/2022, 15:39 - Gracou: It’s someone from outside of the company and the whole thing was agreed upon before I even joined! I hope they don’t look badly on me that I didn’t work out it hadn’t been done :/
22/02/2022, 15:39 - Gracou: I have found influencers it’s just that the emails back in forth with making a deal with them have been taking a long time :/
22/02/2022, 15:40 - Gracou: And I’ve been busy doing so many other things in my job
22/02/2022, 15:41 - Théodore Bedos: Did your boss told you that you did something wrong? Or not enough?
22/02/2022, 15:41 - Gracou: No he said I was doing well and Yh that I have a really great energy that rubs off really well in the rest of the office
22/02/2022, 15:42 - Gracou: But I just don’t think I was able to do my best
22/02/2022, 15:42 - Gracou: To portray myself the best in the meeting
22/02/2022, 15:42 - Gracou: And I want to impress him more
22/02/2022, 15:49 - Théodore Bedos: Babe if he wanted you to do more he would have told you.   Don't kill yourself for not being more than what you can do. It's not even been a month since you are there. Allow yourself some time to set the bases and then destroy everything. Don't try to run before you can walk
22/02/2022, 16:38 - Gracou: I know :/
22/02/2022, 17:07 - Gracou: Thank you baby

24/02/2022, 17:56 - Théodore Bedos: What's so annoying is that they told me that they already filled the position not that I failed
24/02/2022, 17:56 - Théodore Bedos: They even told me that I succeeded the coding test so why did they not let me interview the next round???
24/02/2022, 18:07 - Gracou: That’s really frustrating :/
24/02/2022, 18:08 - Gracou: You should request feedback from them x

01/03/2022, 16:44 - Gracou: We all criticise it
01/03/2022, 16:44 - Gracou: It was silly
01/03/2022, 17:41 - Théodore Bedos: Are your parents still going? Because they would need to get my gift for you at the hotel

02/03/2022, 00:09 - Théodore Bedos: My mom called me to say that if you can't go skiing, she could ask her friend who has an appartement in les Arcs if we could have it for a week for cheap when you'll have your passport. That would be nice but I am not sure that I can fit it in my timetable. I just used all my remainings holidays at Cos for this skiing trip and it might be a bit late to change them.
02/03/2022, 00:09 - Théodore Bedos: But if it's not too late would you want to do it?

03/03/2022, 11:20 - Gracou: Yeah ur still very close to a 2,1 x
03/03/2022, 11:20 - Théodore Bedos: And worst I thought I would have one module under 40, so I would have to retake but they are all above 50
03/03/2022, 11:21 - Gracou: Phew
03/03/2022, 11:21 - Théodore Bedos: So no retake this summer

03/03/2022, 15:32 - Théodore Bedos: I answered that

Hello Dan

I didn't find any section to mention it, but I have ADHD and it affects the time I take for test. 
I ran out of time at 27/50 questions in the first test and 8/10 questions in the second, and took 3h to write the 3 programs which put me in a very low percentage for the  speed.
I think you will agree that my 3 programs worked more than correctly, and that the percentage of good answer in the cognitive tests were high. 
My scores were lowered by the time criteria. If this is right, could you please reconsider your answer now that you know about my disadvantage.

Also, if my disability is a disadvantage in this test, believe me that it is much more of a strength overall. When a subject passionate me I can think longer, harder and much more creatively than others. I might be less efficient but the unique and creative solution that I will be able to find out of the box will make you forget about it.

04/03/2022, 19:19 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah that lake sens, that's why I thought that it might be you with the luggage down my house
04/03/2022, 19:20 - Théodore Bedos: Because if it's not tommorow then no one is gonna bring your passport from Devon and so if we need to go in Saturday you could have come here first today
04/03/2022, 19:21 - Théodore Bedos: I was so excited that it could be you that all of that went through my mind by the time I went to my window
04/03/2022, 19:22 - Gracou: Yeah :)
04/03/2022, 19:23 - Gracou: Sorry baby xo

04/03/2022, 20:39 - Théodore Bedos: And why is your luggage not packed already, you told me to do it in advance
04/03/2022, 20:42 - Gracou: We were never going to take the plane today?

05/03/2022, 08:50 - Gracou: Yes baby
05/03/2022, 08:50 - Gracou: We have had to move our flights
05/03/2022, 08:51 - Gracou: My passport hasn’t arrived
05/03/2022, 08:51 - Gracou: I’m
Hoping it comes soon
05/03/2022, 08:54 - Gracou: You’re going to come to Devon?
05/03/2022, 13:59 - Gracou: Are you bringing ur switch 😊
05/03/2022, 14:18 - Théodore Bedos: Probably not
05/03/2022, 14:18 - Théodore Bedos: I would need to take quiet a few stuff if we wanna connect it to a TV
05/03/2022, 14:21 - Gracou: Ah i see
05/03/2022, 16:23 - Théodore Bedos: In my train to Bristol
05/03/2022, 16:35 - Gracou: Wait, are you running late then?
05/03/2022, 16:40 - Théodore Bedos: No I am arriving at 6
05/03/2022, 16:40 - Théodore Bedos: You told me take the 5 or the 6
05/03/2022, 16:41 - Théodore Bedos: Now I am in the one to Newton abbot
05/03/2022, 16:56 - Gracou: I thought u would get the 5
05/03/2022, 17:10 - Théodore Bedos: You told me to take the 5 or the 6 and you missed half of your train since I know you so I thought it would be better 6
05/03/2022, 17:10 - Théodore Bedos: In case you arrive late
05/03/2022, 17:12 - Gracou: No it’s okay darling I’m not angry
05/03/2022, 17:12 - Gracou: I understand where you are coming from :)
08/03/2022, 12:43 - Gracou: I don’t want to be arguing with you
08/03/2022, 13:10 - Théodore Bedos: Baby, don't treat me like this then
08/03/2022, 13:12 - Gracou: Theo you are making a massive fuss over 1 hour worth of time
08/03/2022, 13:20 - Théodore Bedos: It is not about saving an hour it is about you treating me like a dog since you received your passport. I have the right to give my opinion on the situation and you shouldn't ignore it as you have done
08/03/2022, 13:22 - Gracou: You have the right to give your opinion but you also need to listen to me on it as well. And u also need to raise your opinion at an appopriate time. If this were your trip with your family of course it would be all of your opinions that we went with, but right now I’m trying to do my best to make the decision works for everyone involved, including you, my grandad, and my parents
08/03/2022, 13:23 - Théodore Bedos: It is the exact same thing that you have done in London. I explained it to you that nothing makes me feel more disrespected than that and you keep doing it
08/03/2022, 13:25 - Théodore Bedos: No it wouldn't be all my opinion that we would get with. I would listen to you and judge your opinion as much or more than any other instead of treating you like the least relevant person. The fact that you say that confirms exactly why I am pissed
08/03/2022, 13:26 - Gracou: Theo this is my parents holiday so there opinions on what we should do are the most important
08/03/2022, 13:26 - Gracou: More so than either of ours
08/03/2022, 13:29 - Théodore Bedos: You did not even told them that there was an earlier flight, they might have missed it. They are skiing they could have easily missed it
08/03/2022, 13:36 - Gracou: No my mum stopped skiing so she could try to solve the problem
08/03/2022, 13:36 - Gracou: I heard my uncle checking the flights on the phone
08/03/2022, 13:42 - Théodore Bedos: Did you told it to me this ? No, why would you tell that to your dog. And even though your uncle checked, obviously he missed one so why would you not just ask them as I asked you to?!?!!
08/03/2022, 13:43 - Théodore Bedos: I am never treating you like that, so why do you keep doing it?
08/03/2022, 13:45 - Gracou: No my mum just picked a flight that she thought we could catch! She thought that was the best one!
08/03/2022, 13:46 - Gracou: You are not my dog theo you need to let that accusation go. Sometimes you need to let me take the lead, and sometimes you take the lead that is normal
08/03/2022, 13:50 - Théodore Bedos: No that's not how it works, we are a couple. You should value my opinion as I value yours no matter the situation.
08/03/2022, 13:50 - Gracou: It isn’t that I don’t value your opinion Theodore
08/03/2022, 13:50 - Gracou: I listened to what you had to say and made the decision
08/03/2022, 13:51 - Gracou: It is not worth all the bother of trying to make my mum change the flights it will make her annoyed when she has already put so much effort in and she will probably say no
08/03/2022, 13:51 - Gracou: In fact I have asked and she did say no
08/03/2022, 13:52 - Gracou: It is not treating you like a dog at all
08/03/2022, 13:55 - Théodore Bedos: SHE HAD NOT ALREADY TOOK THE FLIGHT WHEN I SAID ITTTTTT
08/03/2022, 13:55 - Théodore Bedos: Don't change the situation for God sake
08/03/2022, 13:55 - Gracou: She had already made her decision about it though
08/03/2022, 13:55 - Théodore Bedos: I told you and you ignored me
08/03/2022, 13:55 - Gracou: I didn’t ignore you
08/03/2022, 13:55 - Théodore Bedos: I don't talk with you if you rewrite what happened
08/03/2022, 13:56 - Gracou: I’m not at all
08/03/2022, 13:57 - Théodore Bedos: I told you that there was one at 6 and you let her book the flight without saying anything because you treated me like shit
08/03/2022, 13:57 - Gracou: No
08/03/2022, 13:57 - Gracou: That’s not true
08/03/2022, 13:57 - Théodore Bedos: And even later she did not had your passport so she did not booked them anyway so stop lying
08/03/2022, 13:58 - Gracou: She told me she had booked it
08/03/2022, 13:58 - Gracou: She had been booking it everytime without my details
08/03/2022, 13:58 - Gracou: U then just go back and finalise it after with the details
08/03/2022, 13:58 - Gracou: I am just going off of what my mum has told me
08/03/2022, 14:00 - Théodore Bedos: And your mum is not GOD, She is not the only one I  the word that can book a flight, she can make mistake. I am your boyfriend, we have been sharing our life 24h/24h o. The last 3 day the least you could is mention it to her when I told you to instead of ignoring me. Especially when you know that this is the thing that drive me crazy the most
08/03/2022, 14:01 - Gracou: I did mention it to her tho theo I don’t know why u keep saying I haven’t
08/03/2022, 14:02 - Théodore Bedos: You did not
08/03/2022, 14:02 - Gracou: I told her I thought we could get an earlier flight
08/03/2022, 14:03 - Gracou: And she said no
08/03/2022, 16:46 - Gracou: Sorry for making you wait
08/03/2022, 16:46 - Gracou: You can pick where we eat :)
08/03/2022, 22:13 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
09/03/2022, 17:45 - Théodore Bedos: My work is pretty chill so I am free

21/03/2022, 17:07 - Théodore Bedos: You told me that you had not enough people
21/03/2022, 17:08 - Gracou: Not at the moment
21/03/2022, 17:08 - Gracou: I have too many emails constantly that I can’t deal with the people I have
21/03/2022, 17:09 - Théodore Bedos: Not on purpose
21/03/2022, 17:10 - Gracou: Ah
21/03/2022, 20:19 - Théodore Bedos: Have you tested yourself???
21/03/2022, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: Baby?
21/03/2022, 21:15 - Gracou: They didn’t have any tests left at boots :/
21/03/2022, 21:15 - Gracou: I have to try again in the morning
21/03/2022, 21:15 - Théodore Bedos: Babe........
21/03/2022, 21:16 - Gracou: What?
21/03/2022, 21:16 - Théodore Bedos: That's not the sort of stuff that you should take not seriously. You should have went to another boots or another shop
21/03/2022, 21:41 - Gracou: That was the only one that was open Theodore
21/03/2022, 21:41 - Gracou: Of course I would have tried a different one otherwise
21/03/2022, 21:54 - Théodore Bedos: Babe at what time did you go? That's not something you should let for the last time of the day.
21/03/2022, 21:54 - Gracou: I left at 7:15 as soon as I finished work
21/03/2022, 21:54 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry to be hard with you, but this sort of behaviour when you got COVID is what made it such an épidémie
21/03/2022, 21:55 - Gracou: What the heck?
21/03/2022, 21:55 - Gracou: I’ve been at home all day
21/03/2022, 21:55 - Gracou: I didn’t go out
21/03/2022, 21:56 - Théodore Bedos: You've got flatmate, are you wearing a mask at home?
21/03/2022, 21:56 - Gracou: Stop being so rude theo!
21/03/2022, 21:57 - Théodore Bedos: So do the right thing then
21/03/2022, 22:00 - Théodore Bedos: Either you were a mask at home in communal spaces until you know or you make a test. It nearly killed my dad, I am not jocking with this
21/03/2022, 22:12 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
21/03/2022, 22:12 - Gracou: I’m trying to do a uni project right now x

21/03/2022, 23:30 - Théodore Bedos: That explains why they are together in so many movies
21/03/2022, 23:31 - Théodore Bedos: Actually, only 2
21/03/2022, 23:32 - Théodore Bedos: Good night my love

22/03/2022, 17:47 - Théodore Bedos: So what do we do by the way? London or Devon?
22/03/2022, 17:48 - Théodore Bedos: Devon might be cheaper for you, if you prefere
22/03/2022, 19:04 - Gracou: No because the train tickets are expensive xo
22/03/2022, 19:04 - Gracou: London ❤️
22/03/2022, 19:05 - Théodore Bedos: Tell your parents that if they want you to be their for mother's Day you need some support
22/03/2022, 19:16 - Gracou: When will you be arriving btw 😊
22/03/2022, 19:16 - Gracou: No I spoke to my dad And he thinks it’s silly since I’m going home for Easter
22/03/2022, 20:31 - Théodore Bedos: Ok
22/03/2022, 20:32 - Théodore Bedos: I have a few things on Friday evening and afternoon so I could come after
22/03/2022, 20:33 - Théodore Bedos: But I would like to come earlier
22/03/2022, 20:41 - Gracou: So about what time would that be baby? Xo
22/03/2022, 20:41 - Théodore Bedos: That means that I don't know
22/03/2022, 20:53 - Gracou: Ah
22/03/2022, 20:53 - Gracou: But an estimate?
22/03/2022, 21:09 - Théodore Bedos: Could be 10/11 or 3
22/03/2022, 21:35 - Gracou: Okay cool
22/03/2022, 21:35 - Gracou: If it’s 3 you will have to let yourself into my house xo
22/03/2022, 21:36 - Théodore Bedos: Why can I not meet you for drink at your job like last time?
22/03/2022, 21:37 - Gracou: Firstly, we don’t go to the pub at 3, we have never done that
22/03/2022, 21:37 - Gracou: But also, other people don’t bring their partners so I’m
Not sure I can do that every time xo
22/03/2022, 21:41 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf??? So you'd rather have drinks with your colleague while I am by myself in your house when I would have come earlier to spend more time with you than just having me around at your work drink when the last time was 6 weeks ago?
22/03/2022, 21:41 - Théodore Bedos: That's rude Grace
22/03/2022, 21:41 - Gracou: You are being rude theo!
22/03/2022, 21:42 - Gracou: I would have left work drinks early
22/03/2022, 21:42 - Gracou: But I clearly wouldn’t be able to leave work at 3?
22/03/2022, 21:42 - Gracou: The very earliest I could leave would probably be 6:30
22/03/2022, 21:42 - Gracou: But babe I don’t complain when you need to do work things so can’t see me?!
22/03/2022, 21:42 - Théodore Bedos: What? 6:30???
22/03/2022, 21:43 - Théodore Bedos: Why 6:30?
22/03/2022, 21:43 - Théodore Bedos: If you have your drink at 4, why can it not be at 4?
22/03/2022, 21:43 - Gracou: I have to go to drinks theo you are required to go to the pub
22/03/2022, 21:43 - Gracou: It’s a company policy
22/03/2022, 21:43 - Théodore Bedos: Stop it
22/03/2022, 21:44 - Théodore Bedos: You told me last time that many people were missing
22/03/2022, 21:44 - Gracou: YES but I’m the intern
22/03/2022, 21:44 - Théodore Bedos: And you also told me that you only have to stay 1h
22/03/2022, 21:44 - Gracou: I don’t just get to fuck off
22/03/2022, 21:44 - Théodore Bedos: So how come is it 6:30 now?
22/03/2022, 21:44 - Gracou: Theo it’s important for me to be part of the team so that I can’t get a grad offer!
22/03/2022, 21:44 - Gracou: Can*
22/03/2022, 21:45 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf
22/03/2022, 21:45 - Gracou: Why can’t you just understand that I need to go and we agree to meet later?!
22/03/2022, 21:46 - Théodore Bedos: You are spending 40h a week with them. How is staying for drinks 1h instead of 2:30 once every month gonna change anything ????????
22/03/2022, 21:47 - Gracou: Because for 40h a week we all work on seperate desks and focus on work?!
22/03/2022, 21:47 - Gracou: And then we go to the pub for teambuilding

24/03/2022, 08:43 - Théodore Bedos: Did you ask your flatmates if they have one?
24/03/2022, 08:44 - Théodore Bedos: Can you not go somewhere get tested by someone like we did in France
24/03/2022, 08:44 - Théodore Bedos: Is there no where else you can buy a lateral flow?
24/03/2022, 09:28 - Théodore Bedos: How did it go?
24/03/2022, 10:15 - Gracou: They don’t have any
24/03/2022, 10:15 - Gracou: I’m going to try to order some to arrive at the house on the government website
24/03/2022, 10:28 - Théodore Bedos: Is there no other boots near you or could not just get tested on site?
24/03/2022, 10:28 - Gracou: I will have a look

24/03/2022, 10:30 - Gracou: What?

24/03/2022, 10:34 - Théodore Bedos: Once! When you have been in direct contact for multiple hours with someone that has COVID
24/03/2022, 10:37 - Théodore Bedos: Either you need a proper PCR in laboratory, or someone doing a lateral flow for you or doing multiple self tests

24/03/2022, 20:12 - Théodore Bedos: He is irresponsible if he let you back in after one lateral flow test
24/03/2022, 20:13 - Théodore Bedos: And I am very disappointed at you for not doing what I asked you to do seriously.
24/03/2022, 20:13 - Théodore Bedos: It literally took me 5min
24/03/2022, 20:13 - Gracou: I am getting quite tired of you talking like this
24/03/2022, 20:14 - Théodore Bedos: So why don't you just act like an adult directly and do it.
24/03/2022, 20:14 - Théodore Bedos: It's really not wife material like
24/03/2022, 20:14 - Gracou: Dont talk to me like that.
24/03/2022, 20:15 - Théodore Bedos: I told you that I wouldn't come if you did not make a test
24/03/2022, 20:15 - Gracou: <Médias omis>

24/03/2022, 20:37 - Théodore Bedos: You haven't asked me before booking this place. I told you that I had quite a few things to do tomorrow evening, if you don't want to see me earlier then I would have preferred to not miss what I had to do tomorrow evening
24/03/2022, 20:38 - Gracou: I literally made an entire plan to see you Theodore. All this does is prove to me that you were just being angry for the sake of it the other day.
24/03/2022, 20:38 - Théodore Bedos: What??
24/03/2022, 20:38 - Gracou: You assured me that you would rearrange to be able to be there and I planned an evening for us to enjoy together

28/03/2022, 10:06 - Gracou: Thank you for all your lovely cuddles this morning ❤️
28/03/2022, 12:21 - Gracou: I thought you were coming for lunch baby?
28/03/2022, 15:05 - Gracou: What if the witches are the same person
28/03/2022, 15:05 - Gracou: That would explain why she flies in that direction every day
28/03/2022, 15:05 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe
28/03/2022, 15:05 - Gracou: And like the no face, it might just be that she is only bad in the bath house
28/03/2022, 15:05 - Théodore Bedos: Are you reading a theory?
28/03/2022, 15:06 - Théodore Bedos: It might explain why Chihiro called her granny at the very end when she say bye
28/03/2022, 15:06 - Théodore Bedos: The same way she called the nice which
28/03/2022, 15:06 - Gracou: Yes exactly that’s what I thought too
28/03/2022, 15:06 - Gracou: No, I just thought of it myself
28/03/2022, 15:07 - Théodore Bedos: I love you baby
28/03/2022, 15:08 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
28/03/2022, 15:08 - Gracou: Why do U say that?
28/03/2022, 15:09 - Théodore Bedos: Because I love that you make theory like a cute geek
28/03/2022, 15:09 - Gracou: 🤓
28/03/2022, 15:10 - Théodore Bedos: She literally says at some point, we are the two half of the same person
28/03/2022, 15:10 - Gracou: Yeah exactly
28/03/2022, 15:29 - Gracou: Why do u have a box of condoms chilling in your cupboard
28/03/2022, 16:57 - Théodore Bedos: It is the one I bought before our first dates
28/03/2022, 16:57 - Théodore Bedos: We used some of those when I had little penis spots
28/03/2022, 16:58 - Gracou: Okie dokie
28/03/2022, 16:58 - Gracou: I thought it was weird that they seemed so close to the front
28/03/2022, 17:04 - Théodore Bedos: I used one a month ago for wanking, I had no kitchen role and toilet paper is bad
28/03/2022, 17:05 - Théodore Bedos: I don't use anything else in this cupboard often, so it just stayed there
28/03/2022, 17:07 - Gracou: Bahhahahaha
28/03/2022, 17:07 - Gracou: Why not just hold toilet paper in front of it
28/03/2022, 17:07 - Théodore Bedos: It is so bad
28/03/2022, 17:08 - Théodore Bedos: It is so small, so to not have cum splashing on you, you have to make many turn around your dick to cover every hole. And then you can't even feel your penis through all those layers
28/03/2022, 17:11 - Théodore Bedos: And I would never use a sock
28/03/2022, 17:22 - Gracou: Have you ever?
28/03/2022, 17:28 - Gracou: Also babe
28/03/2022, 17:30 - Gracou: Would you be okay for me to work as isaac’s assistant one weekend? Someone else from work did it this weekend and he pays quite well. I really want to be able to do the little Italy trip for my birthday and if I did that once or twice then I think I will be able to afford it much easier :)
28/03/2022, 17:30 - Gracou: I understand that it would make you uncomfortable, but I could honestly use the extra money
28/03/2022, 17:30 - Gracou: If you want to think about it that is okay :)
28/03/2022, 17:31 - Théodore Bedos: What is it? Why does he needs an assistant during the weekends?
28/03/2022, 17:31 - Gracou: He does freelance work
28/03/2022, 17:32 - Gracou: He takes the pictures for Gillette I think
29/03/2022, 11:55 - Gracou: Babe I’m downloading tinder
29/03/2022, 11:55 - Gracou: Bc I want to see our old messages
29/03/2022, 11:55 - Gracou: Im not cheating on u
29/03/2022, 11:57 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
29/03/2022, 12:16 - Théodore Bedos: You said skiing if I remember
29/03/2022, 12:37 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
29/03/2022, 14:21 - Gracou: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMLHqQfrg/
29/03/2022, 14:47 - Théodore Bedos: Easy
29/03/2022, 14:51 - Théodore Bedos: Did you remember to hang out my laundry baby?
29/03/2022, 14:51 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
29/03/2022, 14:51 - Théodore Bedos: Not saying it in an autoritive way
29/03/2022, 14:51 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you very much
29/03/2022, 14:51 - Gracou: Thank you for clarifying
29/03/2022, 18:02 - Théodore Bedos: If you meet me around 8pm at Waitrose we can do shopping for dinner
29/03/2022, 18:02 - Gracou: Super
29/03/2022, 18:02 - Gracou: Im very hungry
29/03/2022, 19:26 - Théodore Bedos: I'll be there in 15min
29/03/2022, 19:40 - Théodore Bedos: Grâce...
30/03/2022, 13:28 - Théodore Bedos: https://youtu.be/aVcxjxLipf0
30/03/2022, 16:46 - Gracou: Play well baby.
30/03/2022, 16:46 - Gracou: X*
30/03/2022, 18:03 - Théodore Bedos: We won
30/03/2022, 18:03 - Théodore Bedos: But I didn't play
30/03/2022, 18:04 - Gracou: Not even once?
30/03/2022, 18:06 - Théodore Bedos: Nope
30/03/2022, 18:06 - Gracou: Dick heads
30/03/2022, 18:09 - Théodore Bedos: It was a really tough game, so I get it. And I would probably agree more if it was me in the position of playing
30/03/2022, 18:09 - Théodore Bedos: But yeah it is still very annoying
30/03/2022, 18:12 - Théodore Bedos: Also, the tradition is to get a MacDonald after the game, which I find a bit silly because it is 6pm. So I don't know what to do because it's gonna be a pain to watch everyone eating a MacDonald if I don't because I would have likes to have dinner with you
30/03/2022, 18:12 - Gracou: When will you be home?
30/03/2022, 18:12 - Gracou: Just get a small nuggets box and eat that and then eat with me after xo
30/03/2022, 18:12 - Gracou: Or we could get maccies when u come back
30/03/2022, 18:18 - Théodore Bedos: I know but it is gonna be so annoying to watch everyone eat when I don't
30/03/2022, 18:24 - Gracou: What time are you back?
30/03/2022, 18:26 - Théodore Bedos: I would have said 8h but because we will stop for a MacDonald maybe 8h30
30/03/2022, 18:37 - Gracou: Can u ask tom to go riding this weekend?
30/03/2022, 18:37 - Gracou: Okay thanks baby

31/03/2022, 09:25 - Théodore Bedos: Or 4pm but that would take all of our last afternoon
31/03/2022, 09:25 - Théodore Bedos: Ok let's do 4pm so that it let us more free Friday evening
31/03/2022, 09:27 - Gracou: Baby you choose x

01/04/2022, 12:26 - Théodore Bedos: Lake
01/04/2022, 12:28 - Théodore Bedos: Because I know you, if you have to finish at 5, it means that you'll do until 5:30, then you'll take 40min to shower and get pretty, and 30min to arrive
01/04/2022, 12:28 - Théodore Bedos: So it'll be too late
01/04/2022, 12:28 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
01/04/2022, 12:29 - Gracou: I am currently not eating lunch to try to get the work done so I can use my lunch break to come up theo

05/04/2022, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: Still doesn't make sense
05/04/2022, 22:19 - Théodore Bedos: It's about a drug dealer and his friend, they witnessed a murder and so they are pursued by the Mafia guy who did the murder. Si they are trying to escape but they are always high and so fucking stupid
05/04/2022, 22:19 - Théodore Bedos: Items with Seth Rogan and James Franco
05/04/2022, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: It's

06/04/2022, 10:13 - Théodore Bedos: I m afraid I won't be able to come to London
06/04/2022, 10:13 - Gracou: Oh
06/04/2022, 10:14 - Théodore Bedos: I am at work
06/04/2022, 10:14 - Gracou: Oh
06/04/2022, 10:14 - Gracou: Why can u go to work but not london
06/04/2022, 10:14 - Théodore Bedos: I have been doing delivery sitting on a wheel chair
06/04/2022, 10:15 - Théodore Bedos: They are very low in staff at the moment so I didn't want to let them down, but clearly I should have been resting
06/04/2022, 10:15 - Gracou: Right
06/04/2022, 10:16 - Théodore Bedos: There is video of me doing the morning scan on a desk wheel chair, it's quiet funny, I'll send it to you
06/04/2022, 10:16 - Gracou: Baby I know you love it but can you please stop doing sports
06/04/2022, 10:16 - Gracou: Just do gymimg and then light sports
06/04/2022, 10:18 - Théodore Bedos: No baby I love it too much
06/04/2022, 10:18 - Gracou: I like ur ankles
06/04/2022, 10:18 - Gracou: And would like to be able to do things with u rather than getting big bulky arm muscles bc I have to push u everywhere
06/04/2022, 10:18 - Gracou: You need to look after yourself
06/04/2022, 10:19 - Gracou: It’s happened too many times for a long time now and u wouldn’t support me doing it if I kept injuring myself like this
06/04/2022, 10:19 - Théodore Bedos: I'll try to see if I can get crushes, maybe in boots. It doesn't seem to bad, so maybe if I have crushes, I'll be able to come.
06/04/2022, 10:20 - Théodore Bedos: But I don't think that walking around train stations, subways with a luggage and through London during weekend is a good idea
06/04/2022, 10:20 - Théodore Bedos: But maybe it will be much better by Friday
06/04/2022, 10:22 - Théodore Bedos: It's not 100% sure but it is a possibility
06/04/2022, 10:33 - Gracou: Yeah
06/04/2022, 10:33 - Gracou: It will be difficult to carry your luggage on crutches
06/04/2022, 10:34 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

06/04/2022, 11:41 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you baby
06/04/2022, 11:43 - Théodore Bedos: If I can't come to London would you consider coming to Bath? And I would come to Devon for a day and a half the week after.
06/04/2022, 11:43 - Théodore Bedos: And London of course the week after Devon
06/04/2022, 11:47 - Théodore Bedos: I made nachos last night, with my own guacamole mad it was absolutely delicious
06/04/2022, 11:48 - Théodore Bedos: Really unhealthy because of the amount of cheese and crisps, but delicious. I am gonna struggle not to do it every evening
06/04/2022, 12:06 - Gracou: Yayy Im glad u enjoyed
06/04/2022, 12:06 - Gracou: Let’s talk about the bath thing on the phone later x
06/04/2022, 19:20 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
07/04/2022, 00:15 - Gracou: Hi baby I tried calling you earlier then I went out for food ❤️
07/04/2022, 00:16 - Gracou: Sorry these notifications didn’t come up on my phone otherwise I would have sent you a message to say why I wasn’t answering xx

07/04/2022, 13:14 - Gracou: Yayyyy
07/04/2022, 13:14 - Gracou: It’s because it’s a bank holiday❤️

07/04/2022, 17:17 - Gracou: Oh dear
07/04/2022, 18:40 - Théodore Bedos: So what do you want to do tommorow?
07/04/2022, 18:40 - Théodore Bedos: I ordered crutches but they hasn't arrived yet
07/04/2022, 18:52 - Théodore Bedos: I am in a meeting
07/04/2022, 18:52 - Gracou: Okay
07/04/2022, 18:54 - Théodore Bedos: I understand that you were here last week. I would come if my ankle wasn't injured. So I feel bad to ask you to come.  I would even be ok to skip this weekend as I'll see you for easter. But I am quiet worried to spend the week end alone here with my injured ankle. I always feel depressed when I injure myself. I wanna bing all the time, I have zero motivation for everything. I don't want to spend the week end alone. I need you
07/04/2022, 19:12 - Théodore Bedos: I had a notification, my crutches just arrived. But it's gonna be a pain to go up to London in crutches.
07/04/2022, 19:34 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
07/04/2022, 19:54 - Gracou: For some reason ur calls don’t come through as notifications for me :/

07/04/2022, 22:19 - Théodore Bedos: Nope I don't know
07/04/2022, 22:38 - Gracou: I need to know bc I need to know whether to pack a suitcase
08/04/2022, 09:54 - Théodore Bedos: When would you like me to come?
08/04/2022, 11:40 - Gracou: Are you coming now? :)
08/04/2022, 12:33 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
08/04/2022, 12:33 - Théodore Bedos: But tell me when
08/04/2022, 12:35 - Théodore Bedos: I have just been to waterstone to buy a book and it literally took me 1h30min with crutches. I hope you are okay that we won't be able to do so much walking through London
08/04/2022, 13:10 - Gracou: It’s okay x
08/04/2022, 13:10 - Gracou: But I don’t want to do nothing :)
08/04/2022, 13:12 - Gracou: Hmm what do u think to 8ish?
08/04/2022, 13:25 - Théodore Bedos: 8????????????
08/04/2022, 13:25 - Théodore Bedos: Why???
08/04/2022, 13:27 - Gracou: I have work drinks and I haven’t been for a month and a half almost
08/04/2022, 13:34 - Théodore Bedos: I am probably just gonna stay home then
08/04/2022, 13:38 - Gracou: Why?
08/04/2022, 13:51 - Théodore Bedos: Baby, you know why
08/04/2022, 14:04 - Gracou: Theo u can’t make me drop my entire life!
08/04/2022, 14:07 - Théodore Bedos: Your entire life?
08/04/2022, 14:09 - Théodore Bedos: I just said that I would come to London on crutches when it was supposed to be your turn to come. And you are saying that I am making you drop your entire life?
08/04/2022, 14:10 - Théodore Bedos: For me asking you not to stay 3h/4h to a work drink that bearely last 2h
08/04/2022, 14:11 - Théodore Bedos: Do you really mean it?
08/04/2022, 15:13 - Gracou: I can’t answer rn
08/04/2022, 15:28 - Théodore Bedos: I just don't get it baby. I have been to your work drink, when we left it was 6 and only 4 people were left. I understand that you want to be there and I would have been fine if you told me that you want to stay 1h30/2h. But I just don't get why you feel the need to stay 4h when I am coming to visit you?
08/04/2022, 15:31 - Théodore Bedos: It really doesn't make me feel like you even want me to come.  You did not even show a sign of excitement when I told you that I would come.
08/04/2022, 15:36 - Théodore Bedos: When you come to Bath, I always go get you and carry your luggage at the train station. How would you react if I wasn't coming to get you at the train station if you had crutches?
08/04/2022, 16:03 - Gracou: Theo I will call u when I finish work x
08/04/2022, 20:39 - Gracou: I love you darling

12/04/2022, 17:57 - Théodore Bedos: And do you know why?
12/04/2022, 20:40 - Gracou: No not really, I just did lots of the jobs that aren’t super glamorous this week
12/04/2022, 20:41 - Gracou: How was your day?
12/04/2022, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: Alright baby, but you can't be sad just because he said that you were great but not amazing. It's already nice to be great and it might just be that he was a bit tired or not in the best mood that day. It has probably nothing to do with you. Don't worry
12/04/2022, 21:51 - Gracou: I know but Lily has been getting a lot of praise recently which makes me feel a bit small
12/04/2022, 21:51 - Gracou: Tell me about your day x
12/04/2022, 21:53 - Théodore Bedos: Normal studying day
12/04/2022, 21:53 - Théodore Bedos: Nothing crazy, nothing bad
12/04/2022, 22:26 - Théodore Bedos: So if you don't want me to come on Thursday then would you like me to come baby?

13/04/2022, 13:38 - Gracou: I can’t 100% confirm, so perhaps friday is better so that I don’t let you down
13/04/2022, 14:05 - Théodore Bedos: Just explain it to me baby, which train are you aiming for and which do you think you might have to take? When do you finish work? What would make you miss the train you aim to take?
13/04/2022, 14:43 - Gracou: I think I will arrive in Newton abbot at 11❤️
13/04/2022, 14:44 - Gracou: Im on thé other side of london at the time so that adds another hour to my journey and since it’s bank holiday weekend I want to be generous about how much time it will take me
13/04/2022, 15:01 - Théodore Bedos: Alright alright, just call me when you are free
13/04/2022, 15:32 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
13/04/2022, 15:32 - Théodore Bedos: I just got the tracki bottom that goes with my ivershirt from cos, with my uniform card
13/04/2022, 15:32 - Théodore Bedos: What do you think?
13/04/2022, 15:32 - Théodore Bedos: Don't know if you remember but I tried it with you once
13/04/2022, 15:33 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
13/04/2022, 18:55 - Gracou: I like the tracky bottoms but I think I would prefer the outfit without the roll neck x
13/04/2022, 19:25 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, thank you
13/04/2022, 19:25 - Théodore Bedos: It's so comfortable
13/04/2022, 19:26 - Théodore Bedos: I tried with a hoodie instead but I look a bit too much like a skater I think
13/04/2022, 22:11 - Gracou: I can imagine it must be amazing
13/04/2022, 22:11 - Gracou: U can show me both if u bring it for Easter xx
13/04/2022, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: I could but I don't really want to be in trackies around your family
13/04/2022, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: Also it's quiet an original outfit, I bet your dad would make fun of it
13/04/2022, 22:21 - Gracou: Baby they are in trackies w u all the time
13/04/2022, 22:21 - Gracou: No he would think it was cool
13/04/2022, 22:22 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah but they are in their house. I don't want to seem like if I was too comfortable
13/04/2022, 22:23 - Gracou: No baby they wouldn’t think that at all
13/04/2022, 22:23 - Gracou: Is that what ur parents think when I’m in pjs?
13/04/2022, 22:24 - Théodore Bedos: No of course not
13/04/2022, 22:26 - Gracou: See ur being silly x
13/04/2022, 22:27 - Théodore Bedos: It's different
13/04/2022, 22:33 - Théodore Bedos: My dad is playing for you. I have never presented a girlfriend before. He has no girlfriend filter, it's maybe the opposite if he could he would try to find me a girlfriend. 
Your dad is the opposite, he is having a very fine filter and he seems to kick out the bad boyfriends.
13/04/2022, 22:33 - Théodore Bedos: I want to keep my image of serious boyfriend. I don't want to think that I am lazy.
13/04/2022, 22:48 - Gracou: Hé has no girlfriend filter 😂😂
13/04/2022, 22:48 - Gracou: That’s silly

24/04/2022, 20:24 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/04/2022, 20:25 - Gracou: This is how much they cost when I arrived so I had to wait for the cost to go down
24/04/2022, 20:25 - Théodore Bedos: Wowwwww
24/04/2022, 20:25 - Gracou: Hopefully I can find something for food since it’s a Sunday 🙃

24/04/2022, 20:25 - Gracou: I tried and couldn’t

24/04/2022, 20:25 - Gracou: It was a mess down there and no one was helping me so I left
24/04/2022, 20:25 - Théodore Bedos: Ohhhhh
24/04/2022, 20:26 - Gracou: And not everywhere has escaliers so I cut my losses before getting to where I couldn’t get back from easily
24/04/2022, 21:10 - Gracou: I only just got home

24/04/2022, 22:31 - Théodore Bedos: Not sure I get why you send me this in particular?
24/04/2022, 22:34 - Gracou: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMLpYj69a/
24/04/2022, 22:35 - Gracou: I just thought it was quite accurate and we had been listening to quite a lot of older songs
24/04/2022, 22:36 - Théodore Bedos: But not Indian song
24/04/2022, 22:36 - Théodore Bedos: That's accurate
24/04/2022, 22:36 - Théodore Bedos: But you're not that mean
24/04/2022, 23:45 - Gracou: I love you so much my big rock xx
24/04/2022, 23:45 - Gracou: Indie*
24/04/2022, 23:45 - Gracou: Yes the one I played u was
24/04/2022, 23:46 - Gracou: I like the 123 pose and then she immediately does it
24/04/2022, 23:46 - Gracou: I hope you are sleeping well❤️❤️
25/04/2022, 11:29 - Théodore Bedos: I'll try that with you
25/04/2022, 11:29 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you
25/04/2022, 11:30 - Théodore Bedos: How did you sleep?
25/04/2022, 12:25 - Gracou: Not that well x I think I was anticipating going back to the office
25/04/2022, 12:25 - Gracou: What about you?
25/04/2022, 13:44 - Théodore Bedos: Not happy about it?
25/04/2022, 13:44 - Gracou: Just anticipation x
25/04/2022, 13:45 - Théodore Bedos: It was okay but too short, I went to bed late to finish my work and I had to wake up early for cos
25/04/2022, 13:45 - Gracou: I have been thinking sexy thoughts about you xx
25/04/2022, 13:45 - Gracou: Oh dear
25/04/2022, 13:45 - Gracou: Is it finished tho?
25/04/2022, 13:47 - Théodore Bedos: 🤭
25/04/2022, 13:48 - Théodore Bedos: Yes except a little part but I couldn't really answer it, so I kept it for discussion with the group
25/04/2022, 13:51 - Gracou: 😊
25/04/2022, 13:51 - Gracou: Good x
25/04/2022, 15:59 - Gracou: Ugh Eli just asked me what I want to do after uni and I went on a massive ramble in front of the whole office 🤦🏽‍♀️
25/04/2022, 15:59 - Gracou: I wish I hadn’t
25/04/2022, 16:01 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
25/04/2022, 16:01 - Théodore Bedos: What is a massive rumble?
25/04/2022, 17:39 - Gracou: Ramble means talk for a long time
25/04/2022, 17:39 - Gracou: I can’t watch rn but this looks funny
25/04/2022, 22:03 - Théodore Bedos: I need to call you
25/04/2022, 23:34 - Théodore Bedos: Good night baby
26/04/2022, 00:17 - Gracou: I love you so much x
26/04/2022, 00:17 - Gracou: Babe I’m so Hairy this is gross
26/04/2022, 00:18 - Gracou: I can’t bare to watch any more of it it is so gross and embarrassing
26/04/2022, 03:51 - Théodore Bedos: No it's not gross baby
26/04/2022, 03:52 - Théodore Bedos: Watch it to the end you are funny at the end
26/04/2022, 07:56 - Gracou: Theo why were you up that late!
26/04/2022, 09:55 - Théodore Bedos: I has a nightmare
26/04/2022, 10:25 - Gracou: What happened?
26/04/2022, 10:50 - Théodore Bedos: I thought that some people were breaking in my flat in Paris and they had guns. But I didn't do any night walking stuff, I just walked up suddenly
26/04/2022, 10:51 - Théodore Bedos: But I needed to calm down before going back to sleep, so I texted you
26/04/2022, 11:10 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/04/2022, 12:50 - Théodore Bedos: I messaged Tom about Wiktoria issue, he said that he would be ok for us to live at 3 but it would cost 33% extra. I thanked him for the proposition, but said that I was against it because we need more space. I then said that I think that it is not fair for you that Wiktoria's late choice would put you in this situation. And that I hope that he would agree with my opinion. He said that it was up to me to decide and that he was happy either way.
26/04/2022, 14:56 - Gracou: Oh no
26/04/2022, 14:56 - Gracou: Beautiful!
26/04/2022, 14:57 - Gracou: Not very nice of tom to ask us to pay 33% more
26/04/2022, 14:57 - Gracou: Especially when we know his bills wouldn’t increase
26/04/2022, 14:57 - Gracou: That’s actually quite rude
26/04/2022, 16:17 - Théodore Bedos: Hi Theo, I’m happy for you all to live their if you and grace will be sharing a room? Up to you. But obviously the contract would have a third person on there so there would be 33% more to pay.
26/04/2022, 16:17 - Théodore Bedos: That's what he said
26/04/2022, 16:18 - Théodore Bedos: I don't think it's that rude and anyway I don't care because I don't want to live at 3
26/04/2022, 16:19 - Gracou: There is no logic behind it tho
26/04/2022, 16:19 - Gracou: Anyway yes clearly we won’t do that
26/04/2022, 18:36 - Gracou: I guess we have to consider whether we would consider trying to find another apartment for three of us
26/04/2022, 18:58 - Théodore Bedos: We could do but honestly I really like this appartement, I have been working very well here before and I don't want to risk my final year.
26/04/2022, 18:59 - Théodore Bedos: I have discussed with her again just a few minutes ago and I made it clear that you were gonna move here
26/04/2022, 19:35 - Gracou: So, we are kicking her onto the street?
26/04/2022, 19:52 - Théodore Bedos: No, she is an adult she will find something. And I'll help her
26/04/2022, 20:30 - Gracou: Okay
27/04/2022, 00:07 - Gracou: What did Wiktoria say back when you told her?
27/04/2022, 00:15 - Théodore Bedos: She cried, but she took it better than yesterday. I told her that we could live at three but that honestly I didn't wanted to. I think that it would be risky for our couple to be constantly together in such a small space and risky for my final year to not have my own calm space for working. So that it was selfish of me, but I didn't want to risk my couple and my final year just for the sake of you. Even though it is really hard for me to say that. 
She took it well and said that she really wants us to stay friends.
27/04/2022, 00:20 - Gracou: Im glad at least that she took it better
27/04/2022, 00:20 - Gracou: I don’t think we could live as three of us in the apartment
27/04/2022, 00:32 - Gracou: I love you baby goodnight xx sorry I didn’t call you
27/04/2022, 10:44 - Gracou: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMLsN8mFC/
27/04/2022, 11:09 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
27/04/2022, 12:28 - Gracou: Are you okay baby?
27/04/2022, 13:28 - Théodore Bedos: Yes baby
27/04/2022, 13:28 - Théodore Bedos: I have been very very busy
27/04/2022, 13:43 - Gracou: Okay baby i just wanted to check xxxx
27/04/2022, 14:30 - Théodore Bedos: Can I call you?
27/04/2022, 14:33 - Théodore Bedos: Don't worry, just wanted to explain you that I worked late then went on a drink with Jim. And I had to go straight to bed after because I had Cos at 8am and right after Cos I had the activity interview for the summer placement.  So that's why I couldn't answer
27/04/2022, 20:51 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
27/04/2022, 20:53 - Théodore Bedos: See from where I come babe.  Think about our ex president's English next time you criticise my English
27/04/2022, 21:16 - Gracou: Im confused
27/04/2022, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: Is their English not funny?
28/04/2022, 00:27 - Gracou: Sorry for not wring the message earlier x
28/04/2022, 00:27 - Gracou: I adore you big sexy baby
28/04/2022, 09:43 - Théodore Bedos: I got the job!!!!!!!!
28/04/2022, 12:40 - Théodore Bedos: https://youtu.be/_b-FN_IT5fU
28/04/2022, 12:41 - Théodore Bedos: That's very funny, and you can set good subtitles in English
28/04/2022, 12:42 - Théodore Bedos: You should find the beginning very funny when he talks about what is wtf in the french language
28/04/2022, 15:36 - Théodore Bedos: What would you think if we took Jim and Elena's flat instead of ours for next year? They have a Balcony.
It's unfurnished but they pay less and I think that the difference of money can easily cover furnitures. And if we buy furnitures we could eventually sell them back or keep them if you we want to live together later.
28/04/2022, 15:54 - Théodore Bedos: Oh there would be around 100/150 bills per months, so it would just be around 800pounds cheaper. But there is already a fridge, washing machines, oven. So there is a sofa, a bed, a table, and chairs to buy.
28/04/2022, 15:54 - Théodore Bedos: And it would be 12minths instead of 8. Which means we would have it for the summer when we need to wait for graduation.
28/04/2022, 15:57 - Théodore Bedos: I have to say I love my appartement, where it is, having a dishwasher, having Tom as a landlord but in the other hand I am not insensible to having. Having a good shower, having a balcony.
28/04/2022, 15:57 - Théodore Bedos: And having it over the summer
28/04/2022, 17:31 - Gracou: Sorry baby I can’t answer fully right now but I will have a think about this x
28/04/2022, 17:32 - Gracou: It could be difficult to buy all of this for £800 with moving fees added in x
28/04/2022, 17:32 - Gracou: Also is this to have Wiktoria with us?
28/04/2022, 17:32 - Gracou: And we would have to think also about how close this is to campus
28/04/2022, 17:32 - Gracou: But a balcony would be so so nice
28/04/2022, 17:55 - Théodore Bedos: No this would be just the 2 of us and we would let Tom's appartement to Wiktoria.
28/04/2022, 17:55 - Théodore Bedos: It is closer to campus
28/04/2022, 17:56 - Théodore Bedos: But so it is less close to town
28/04/2022, 17:56 - Théodore Bedos: It is basically just at the bottom of Bathwick hill
28/04/2022, 17:59 - Gracou: I see
28/04/2022, 18:00 - Gracou: Would they let me go and look around it? Or do a video tour maybe?
28/04/2022, 21:22 - Gracou: Hi baby I’m at work drinks xo
28/04/2022, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: Yes of course
28/04/2022, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: Ok
28/04/2022, 21:24 - Gracou: Thank you my love x
28/04/2022, 23:01 - Gracou: Thank you for taking my points on board about the shower and what not x
29/04/2022, 00:56 - Gracou: I love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
29/04/2022, 08:27 - Théodore Bedos: Love you too
29/04/2022, 09:09 - Gracou: Did you have a good evening?
29/04/2022, 09:35 - Théodore Bedos: Not the best, I have had a meeting from 10am to 10pm with my team for finishing my deadline. It was very intense
29/04/2022, 09:38 - Théodore Bedos: Your evening seemed a lot funnier
29/04/2022, 09:39 - Gracou: How did u know I was having fun?
29/04/2022, 09:39 - Gracou: That is very intense
29/04/2022, 09:39 - Théodore Bedos: Because you told me
29/04/2022, 09:41 - Gracou: I just said I was at work drinks
29/04/2022, 09:41 - Gracou: But yes it was fun :)
29/04/2022, 09:41 - Gracou: I quite like the new girl Grace
29/04/2022, 09:42 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
29/04/2022, 09:43 - Gracou: She is just very funny and silly
29/04/2022, 09:43 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
29/04/2022, 09:45 - Théodore Bedos: Nice
29/04/2022, 09:45 - Théodore Bedos: I like ice age 3
29/04/2022, 09:45 - Gracou: Aw u got the red that’s so cool babe
29/04/2022, 09:45 - Gracou: Ref*
29/04/2022, 09:46 - Gracou: You’re so in touch with pop culture
29/04/2022, 09:46 - Gracou: Very attractive
29/04/2022, 09:46 - Théodore Bedos: I live ice age
29/04/2022, 09:46 - Théodore Bedos: Love
29/04/2022, 09:47 - Théodore Bedos: I have a good news my placement will finish the 5th of August instead of the 13th of August. So we would have an extra week before Thailand to go to France or do something.
29/04/2022, 09:48 - Gracou: Yayyyy
29/04/2022, 09:48 - Gracou: That’s very good news :):)
29/04/2022, 09:48 - Théodore Bedos: Or not do something, but it will just be less stressful because Thaïlande is the 16th
29/04/2022, 09:48 - Gracou: Yes it will be much nicer
29/04/2022, 09:48 - Gracou: We may as well go for at least a couple of days in Paris or something
29/04/2022, 09:51 - Théodore Bedos: Yes but we could also do it in the way back, so we are not oblige to do it before
29/04/2022, 09:52 - Gracou: Okay baby x
29/04/2022, 19:21 - Théodore Bedos: Did your parents said something about their basketball games that got cancelled?
29/04/2022, 19:22 - Théodore Bedos: It was cancelled not moved so they will be paid back.
29/04/2022, 19:22 - Théodore Bedos: And it was before they left so luckily they had chance to plan something else
29/04/2022, 19:25 - Théodore Bedos: They were supposed to see the game 6, but Boston won in only 4 games against Brooklyn. It was such an upset, everyone was so surprised. Brooklyn was the favourite to win the cup. So losing 4-0 on 1st round was hard to guess as you can imagine
29/04/2022, 19:25 - Théodore Bedos: I hope they are not annoyed
29/04/2022, 21:28 - Gracou: It’s okay I already warned them that it would probably happen x
29/04/2022, 22:52 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight baby, I miss you 😘😘
29/04/2022, 23:51 - Gracou: Did u talk to Jim?
30/04/2022, 08:16 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I will visit it tommorow
30/04/2022, 08:16 - Théodore Bedos: At 6
30/04/2022, 09:53 - Gracou: Goodnight my love I miss you too❤️❤️❤️
30/04/2022, 09:53 - Gracou: Thank you x
30/04/2022, 10:15 - Théodore Bedos: I was looking at furnitures on Ikea to see how much it would cost to buy a bed and a few other stuff. And it made me realised that I quiet like the idea to make or own home together
30/04/2022, 10:15 - Théodore Bedos: Our own*
30/04/2022, 10:15 - Gracou: Awww 🥺
30/04/2022, 18:48 - Gracou: Did u not go to Jim’s in the end?
30/04/2022, 19:12 - Gracou: By the way I thought this was such a lovely message
30/04/2022, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: ❤️❤️❤️
30/04/2022, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: It's tomorrow
30/04/2022, 20:05 - Gracou: Ahh
30/04/2022, 20:05 - Gracou: My bad
30/04/2022, 20:53 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
30/04/2022, 20:54 - Théodore Bedos: I should have not done it with you, now it is too hard not to do it every evening
30/04/2022, 20:54 - Gracou: Yummy well done baby
30/04/2022, 20:54 - Gracou: You said the same thing about nachos
30/04/2022, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: True
30/04/2022, 21:18 - Gracou: Please can u take how I feel seriously darling
30/04/2022, 21:22 - Gracou: I thought that Jim and elenas flat is two bedrooms but they just converted one of them to an office/twitch room?
30/04/2022, 21:54 - Théodore Bedos: I definatly understand how you feel and why you would like a second room. But could we not have everything that a second room offer without having a second room. If you need to get away from me, Jim's appartement is big enough to. You could go on the balcony, the living room, the office or the kitchen. If you want someone over, we could have a convertible sofa. And you could use the convertible sofa and the office to work late if you want.
30/04/2022, 21:55 - Théodore Bedos: Also, it just make me feel like you don't believe in us. That you need a second room in case it fucked up. And that's really not a nice thought
30/04/2022, 23:05 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight baby, I love you 😘
30/04/2022, 23:22 - Gracou: Wait, so they do have a seperate office room that could be a bedroom?
01/05/2022, 03:59 - Gracou: Darling did you ignore what I said in my message? Of course I live you to
01/05/2022, 07:07 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
01/05/2022, 07:07 - Théodore Bedos: No look, I have sent it before yours
01/05/2022, 07:10 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, they have a little office
01/05/2022, 11:45 - Gracou: So it’s a two bedroom apartment!
01/05/2022, 11:46 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
01/05/2022, 11:58 - Théodore Bedos: If you want to call it like that yes. But from what I remember it is small
01/05/2022, 11:58 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway, you'll see this evening
01/05/2022, 13:15 - Théodore Bedos: By the way, your Dad's jacket should be arrived
01/05/2022, 13:26 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
01/05/2022, 13:34 - Gracou: Theo having an office room doesn’t even make sense- we are going to need separate rooms we can work in
01/05/2022, 13:35 - Gracou: Not one shared working room
01/05/2022, 15:09 - Théodore Bedos: Babe, let's not be nasty to each others. 
First I love to work with you. I don't mind sharing it, I just want a space dedicated to work.
Then, it's not really the idea of not having an office that I am against. It's the fact to have two have two rooms. I don't want to be your flatmate. I want to share my life with you and our room too. And if you need some space for you I will always be happy to let you our room, to go to the library if you want to have the flat just for you and friend, to be weaken up when you'll come to bed very late.
01/05/2022, 15:11 - Gracou: I’m not ready to live completely like that yet darling
01/05/2022, 15:11 - Gracou: It would still be our space
01/05/2022, 15:13 - Gracou: For me this is the next step in our relationship, but I don’t feel that I can completely give up on having my own space too
01/05/2022, 15:35 - Théodore Bedos: Why don't we try it baby? We are so good at loving each others, I am sure that we could skip a step. And if it appears that we can't then, we could still change it, buy a bed and adapt.
01/05/2022, 15:38 - Gracou: Please can we start with the bed darling
01/05/2022, 17:39 - Théodore Bedos: Baby if we start already thinking that we can't support each other, surely it will happen. It's like trying to learn German for me or French for you when you can already speak English, every time we face an issue it's so easy to just speak in English. And it would be the same here, when we would have na argue we would just go in separate rooms instead of solving the issue together. I am sure that it will help us not to have such an easy exit. Please believe in us my love.
01/05/2022, 17:43 - Théodore Bedos: If we aim for failure first, it's more likely to fail. Let's not think that it will go badly, and we will succeed
01/05/2022, 17:44 - Gracou: It’s not a failure to have our own bedrooms theo
01/05/2022, 17:45 - Gracou: I don’t want the room because I think it will go badly
01/05/2022, 17:45 - Gracou: But your whole perspective on not understanding me wanting that space makes me really worried
01/05/2022, 17:45 - Gracou: It doesn’t have anything to do with our relationship
01/05/2022, 17:46 - Gracou: I just want my own space in the place I live
01/05/2022, 17:46 - Gracou: I will still sleep in your bed i just want to have that there
01/05/2022, 17:49 - Gracou: It’s not that I don’t think you can support me or anything like that darling
01/05/2022, 17:52 - Théodore Bedos: And what do you think that it does to me? Literally 2 weeks ago you told me that you felt smothered by me and that you need space away and now that you need a sperate space away from me
01/05/2022, 17:54 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you say in your bed, it will be our bed
01/05/2022, 17:55 - Gracou: Because you said it was greedy to call it ours if I wanted a separate room
01/05/2022, 17:56 - Gracou: Why can’t you see it from the perspective that moving in with me in this way is still gaining closeness?
01/05/2022, 17:56 - Gracou: We currently don’t even live in the same city let alone same apartment!
01/05/2022, 17:56 - Théodore Bedos: Baby I see perfectly your point, I just don't want to be your flatmate
01/05/2022, 17:57 - Gracou: Okay
01/05/2022, 17:57 - Gracou: But having a seperate room wouldn’t make you any more or less my flatmate than if we used it to put desks in
01/05/2022, 18:00 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it does, you want to have your own space line what you would do with your friends. But that's not what adult couples do, your parents, my parents, Jim, Will, Huw, Lucy, they all share their rooms. If we can't share a room what would it be with salaries,  property, kids, whatever....
01/05/2022, 18:05 - Gracou: Theo me moving in with you as a student is not the same as getting married
01/05/2022, 18:05 - Gracou: All couples need their own spaces
01/05/2022, 18:05 - Gracou: Please can you stop comparing to everyone else’s relationships that you don’t understand and listen to what your partner is saying she needs
01/05/2022, 18:05 - Gracou: Are u at Jim and elenas?
01/05/2022, 18:35 - Gracou: Theo are you planning to do the call as we said?
01/05/2022, 18:47 - Gracou: Theo I have been waiting for the call for almost 50 mins
01/05/2022, 18:47 - Théodore Bedos: For the call??
01/05/2022, 18:47 - Théodore Bedos: I took videos
01/05/2022, 18:47 - Théodore Bedos: I just left
01/05/2022, 18:47 - Gracou: I asked you to WhatsApp call me
01/05/2022, 18:48 - Gracou: Theo!
01/05/2022, 18:48 - Théodore Bedos: Oh really?
01/05/2022, 18:48 - Gracou: Yes
01/05/2022, 18:48 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't know
01/05/2022, 18:48 - Gracou: We have spoken about it so many times
01/05/2022, 18:48 - Gracou: And I always said a call
01/05/2022, 18:48 - Théodore Bedos: Should I go back, I am in the stairs or are you ok with the video
01/05/2022, 18:48 - Théodore Bedos: And oictures
01/05/2022, 18:49 - Gracou: I would have preferred the video call to be honest
01/05/2022, 18:49 - Théodore Bedos: So do you want me to go back
01/05/2022, 18:49 - Gracou: How good are your videos
01/05/2022, 18:49 - Théodore Bedos: Good
01/05/2022, 18:49 - Théodore Bedos: Ok let's ask
01/05/2022, 18:49 - Gracou: I can just watch them I suppose :/
01/05/2022, 18:51 - Théodore Bedos: Babe
01/05/2022, 18:51 - Théodore Bedos: I am in their flat
01/05/2022, 18:52 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
01/05/2022, 18:57 - Gracou: Can you please tell them a really big thank you from me!

01/05/2022, 20:03 - Théodore Bedos: I forgot to take a picture of the big room
01/05/2022, 20:04 - Théodore Bedos: I personally think that it was better when they had their room in their actual office. I feel that their room is too small now
01/05/2022, 20:51 - Gracou: I think the apartment is really nice
01/05/2022, 20:51 - Gracou: And I love you
01/05/2022, 20:59 - Théodore Bedos: I love you too

01/05/2022, 22:30 - Théodore Bedos: I barely know any of them! Where do you know them from?
01/05/2022, 22:31 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to bed babe, I miss you a lot! Have a good evening with them
01/05/2022, 22:51 - Gracou: My course darling
01/05/2022, 22:51 - Gracou: I miss you too
02/05/2022, 01:58 - Gracou: Theo I just wanted to say that I love you and you’re the only one I want to be with
02/05/2022, 01:59 - Gracou: I understand that the way you feel is difficult but we are just in different stages of how we perceive our life and neither of us is wrong
02/05/2022, 02:00 - Gracou: And we clearly both love eachother and don’t want to be nasty towards each other
02/05/2022, 02:01 - Gracou: But I really hope you can still love me and be with me even though I feel this is something that I need
02/05/2022, 01:53 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué

I’m completely committed to you and see our future together xx

05/05/2022, 12:57 - Théodore Bedos: Not surprised
05/05/2022, 12:57 - Théodore Bedos: Is your work not going to pay it back
05/05/2022, 12:57 - Théodore Bedos: ?

06/05/2022, 13:46 - Gracou: Missing you already
06/05/2022, 13:47 - Gracou: In the shuttle to the airport but it’s soooooo hot
06/05/2022, 13:47 - Théodore Bedos: Now???
06/05/2022, 13:47 - Gracou: Yes
06/05/2022, 13:47 - Théodore Bedos: I thought it was a lot later
06/05/2022, 13:47 - Gracou: It’s at 5
06/05/2022, 13:47 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
06/05/2022, 13:47 - Théodore Bedos: Can you explain me what does she mean by reference contact?
06/05/2022, 13:47 - Gracou: Exciting!!!!!!!
06/05/2022, 13:48 - Gracou: How much are they paying u?
06/05/2022, 13:48 - Théodore Bedos: 22k
06/05/2022, 13:48 - Gracou: That means send him an example of a contract I think
06/05/2022, 13:48 - Gracou: But that’s a really weird thing to ask
06/05/2022, 13:48 - Gracou: Wooo!
06/05/2022, 13:48 - Théodore Bedos: It's not Contract it is Contact
06/05/2022, 13:55 - Gracou: Ohh
06/05/2022, 13:55 - Gracou: Yeah a reference from someone u used to work for
06/05/2022, 13:55 - Gracou: Like a paragraph from Helen that says what ur like and whether she was happy about u
06/05/2022, 13:55 - Gracou: So give Helen as ur reference contact
06/05/2022, 13:55 - Gracou: And give them her email/number
06/05/2022, 13:57 - Théodore Bedos: What does it mean when she say " to start chasing up" ?
06/05/2022, 13:58 - Gracou: It just means that he is going to keep bothering them to give him something
06/05/2022, 13:59 - Théodore Bedos: She is gonna ask Helen directly?
06/05/2022, 14:05 - Gracou: She might do, some don’t bother
06/05/2022, 14:06 - Gracou: So the polite thing to do is ask whether Helen will be your reference
06/05/2022, 14:06 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, thanks
06/05/2022, 14:06 - Théodore Bedos: That's what I thought
06/05/2022, 14:07 - Théodore Bedos: I just had a doubt that it was an emergency contact like my mum that they wanted
06/05/2022, 14:08 - Gracou: No i don’t think so x that w would be really weird of them to phrase it like that
06/05/2022, 14:43 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
06/05/2022, 14:43 - Gracou: My cat came back :)

09/05/2022, 17:57 - Gracou: Yes so connected and in tune
09/05/2022, 17:57 - Gracou: It must be because we align our third eye so often
09/05/2022, 18:09 - Théodore Bedos: Surely
09/05/2022, 18:10 - Théodore Bedos: And because we would love each other even if we were chickens

10/05/2022, 06:52 - Théodore Bedos: Are you home?
10/05/2022, 07:00 - Théodore Bedos: Could you ask Sally if Carl and her would leave their appartement this summer? Because I need to find a place to stay during my placement and their appartement is literally 10m away from the office.
10/05/2022, 11:57 - Gracou: I can ask them x
10/05/2022, 11:58 - Gracou: But sally normally stays year round, she hasn’t been back to her family in the Philippines for years
10/05/2022, 12:55 - Gracou: Have you confirmed w Jim and elenas landlord that we will take the apartment?
10/05/2022, 12:59 - Théodore Bedos: Yes but they are waiting for the landlord to confirm. There is a possibility that the landlord doesn't because we are students. Whereas Elena was not when she got the contract under her name
10/05/2022, 13:04 - Gracou: Oh no
10/05/2022, 13:05 - Gracou: Do you think he will feel strongly about it?
10/05/2022, 13:05 - Théodore Bedos: No clue
10/05/2022, 13:06 - Gracou: Okay, m’y fingers are crossed
10/05/2022, 13:06 - Théodore Bedos: Jim told her that we were mature studenta
10/05/2022, 13:06 - Gracou: Hahaha
10/05/2022, 13:06 - Gracou: Hopefully that works
10/05/2022, 18:17 - Théodore Bedos: 😘😘😘

10/05/2022, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: Jim told me that his landlord is hesitating because she might just sell the appartement
11/05/2022, 00:31 - Gracou: Noooo
11/05/2022, 00:32 - Gracou: How soon will they decide?
11/05/2022, 00:32 - Gracou: Ask the landlord to meet us or something to see that we are nice
11/05/2022, 00:32 - Gracou: I love you so much goodnight xxx
11/05/2022, 07:31 - Théodore Bedos: I just thought again of the nice manga you got me, and it really touches me that you did this. It makes me very happy
11/05/2022, 09:44 - Gracou: Im really really glad that it makes you happy x
11/05/2022, 09:44 - Gracou: I didn’t know whether you would think it was silly because it’s in Italian
11/05/2022, 10:08 - Théodore Bedos: It's a bit silly but that's what touches me even more. You could have think, no I am not gonna get it because he can't read it but instead you decided to get me a surprise anyway. So I am really happy
11/05/2022, 11:39 - Gracou: Awww :)

11/05/2022, 14:43 - Théodore Bedos: I don't get it
11/05/2022, 14:44 - Théodore Bedos: She says that she can't recommend me someone. But then she does.
11/05/2022, 14:44 - Théodore Bedos: What does that mean
11/05/2022, 14:57 - Gracou: He is sort of like a manager
11/05/2022, 14:57 - Gracou: Thé Will ‘contract’ a plumber for a job for you
11/05/2022, 14:57 - Gracou: It’s like going through another agent
11/05/2022, 15:00 - Gracou: Are you going to go to the summer ball? :)

14/05/2022, 21:49 - Gracou: The jubilee weekend x
14/05/2022, 21:49 - Théodore Bedos: Because I'd like to go to Germany see my friends and maybe skydive, before I start my placement
14/05/2022, 21:49 - Théodore Bedos: Because after it's Thailand and maybe France with you so I won't have time
14/05/2022, 21:50 - Gracou: Ah okay
14/05/2022, 21:50 - Gracou: No problem baby
14/05/2022, 21:51 - Théodore Bedos: I probably won't then, because I need to do all my y flat cleaning and living my stuff on the 5th of June

14/05/2022, 21:52 - Gracou: Well hopefully Wiktoria will make sure it’s tidy
14/05/2022, 21:52 - Gracou: But the bed will be difficult by yourself

14/05/2022, 21:53 - Gracou: Yes x

14/05/2022, 21:53 - Gracou: Yes x
14/05/2022, 21:54 - Théodore Bedos: And then I come back in the 12th for my placement. I will see you every 2 weeks as it is now

15/05/2022, 00:30 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
15/05/2022, 00:30 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
15/05/2022, 00:52 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
15/05/2022, 08:40 - Théodore Bedos: Oh I didn't recognised Darcy at first
15/05/2022, 08:40 - Théodore Bedos: Why are you sending me these
15/05/2022, 08:40 - Théodore Bedos: I forgot about that
15/05/2022, 08:40 - Théodore Bedos: It was fun
15/05/2022, 11:31 - Gracou: Just because I was looking through my pictures
15/05/2022, 12:38 - Gracou: Babe on l’agence they are showing some rlly nice houses in Normandy
15/05/2022, 12:38 - Gracou: And the house prices are much cheaper
15/05/2022, 12:38 - Gracou: Very pretty houses
15/05/2022, 12:57 - Théodore Bedos: Wanna leave in France?
15/05/2022, 12:59 - Gracou: Well there are two houses that have been on, one in Normandy and one in the south that I would definitely live in
15/05/2022, 12:59 - Gracou: I will have to show you
15/05/2022, 13:00 - Gracou: The one in Normandy I can imagine us waltzing in the garden as the sunsets
15/05/2022, 15:06 - Théodore Bedos: You'll have to show me that
15/05/2022, 15:22 - Théodore Bedos: I am at work
15/05/2022, 15:23 - Gracou: Okay i was just calling to tell you I’m doing to the hospital x
15/05/2022, 15:28 - Théodore Bedos: Oh really
15/05/2022, 15:29 - Théodore Bedos: Did they told you to come or not?
15/05/2022, 15:29 - Théodore Bedos: Because going in a hospital with COVID is the last thing do ever!!!
15/05/2022, 15:29 - Gracou: Yea they said I need to be seen within an hour
15/05/2022, 15:29 - Gracou: I told them I’ve tested positive for covid and they still said they wanted me to come
15/05/2022, 15:30 - Théodore Bedos: But it was yesterday
15/05/2022, 15:30 - Gracou: What do you mean
15/05/2022, 15:30 - Théodore Bedos: It was yesterday that you touched the needle. So why today you need to see them in the hour
15/05/2022, 15:31 - Théodore Bedos: Also why are they now so stressed when yesterday they said the opposite
15/05/2022, 15:32 - Gracou: Because I have pins and needles in my arms and hands
15/05/2022, 15:32 - Théodore Bedos: Wow ok
15/05/2022, 15:33 - Théodore Bedos: This is probably fever due to COVID , because if had gotten something from the needle it would be too short
15/05/2022, 15:33 - Théodore Bedos: Have you taken paracetamol, that will help
15/05/2022, 15:33 - Gracou: Theo I’m going to do what the doctors tell me
15/05/2022, 15:33 - Gracou: I agree I said the same thing
15/05/2022, 15:33 - Gracou: Yes I’ve had paracetamol
15/05/2022, 15:34 - Théodore Bedos: I am not saying the opposite. I am just trying to reassure you
15/05/2022, 15:34 - Théodore Bedos: It does that often to me when I have a lot of fever
15/05/2022, 15:34 - Gracou: Yes
15/05/2022, 15:34 - Gracou: At least they are going to see me, that’s good
15/05/2022, 15:43 - Théodore Bedos: Yes that's good
15/05/2022, 15:43 - Théodore Bedos: When did you took the paracetamol?
15/05/2022, 15:43 - Gracou: 12:30
15/05/2022, 15:44 - Gracou: The people here have said I should have come yesterday
15/05/2022, 15:44 - Théodore Bedos: I think too
15/05/2022, 15:44 - Gracou: Bc even if it’s just a scratch, I might need a tetnis jab
15/05/2022, 15:44 - Théodore Bedos: And you still have the pain and niddles, or is it gone now???
15/05/2022, 15:44 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, that's true
15/05/2022, 15:44 - Gracou: I still have it
15/05/2022, 15:45 - Théodore Bedos: Alright don't worry
15/05/2022, 15:45 - Théodore Bedos: Is someone coming with you?
15/05/2022, 15:45 - Théodore Bedos: Are you not vaccines for that?
15/05/2022, 15:45 - Gracou: Idk that’s just what she said
15/05/2022, 15:45 - Gracou: No I’m by myself
15/05/2022, 15:48 - Théodore Bedos: Are you on a cab
15/05/2022, 15:48 - Théodore Bedos: Rrrrr, one of your faltmate should have come
15/05/2022, 15:52 - Théodore Bedos: You need to not tired yourself, because if it is the fever it will make it worse if you move a lot
15/05/2022, 15:53 - Gracou: No I’m okay darling
15/05/2022, 15:53 - Gracou: The second nurse I saw wasn’t very nice
15/05/2022, 15:59 - Théodore Bedos: What did they say?
15/05/2022, 16:01 - Gracou: Just a bit rude
15/05/2022, 16:01 - Gracou: They are expecting me to wait here for 4-5 hours
15/05/2022, 16:10 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf!!!
15/05/2022, 16:10 - Théodore Bedos: Did they gave you something
15/05/2022, 16:11 - Théodore Bedos: I mean what did they say about your scratch and your pain and needles
15/05/2022, 16:12 - Théodore Bedos: Are you feeling alright now
15/05/2022, 16:49 - Théodore Bedos: Baby? Are you ok?
15/05/2022, 17:21 - Gracou: Im okay x
15/05/2022, 17:21 - Gracou: Ive booked in at a private clinic tomorrow
15/05/2022, 17:21 - Gracou: Instead of waiting 5 hours in a crowded room while I have covid
15/05/2022, 17:22 - Gracou: They said that it probably wasn’t the needle - so I think it’s just covid
15/05/2022, 17:28 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah I think it is the fever from COVID, I have had the same before.
15/05/2022, 17:28 - Théodore Bedos: But it's good that you go to clinic to check for the tetanis
15/05/2022, 20:05 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
15/05/2022, 20:08 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
15/05/2022, 21:51 - Gracou: I wanna watch aquaman two
15/05/2022, 22:34 - Théodore Bedos: Why not
15/05/2022, 23:04 - Gracou: I miss u
15/05/2022, 23:06 - Théodore Bedos: I do too
15/05/2022, 23:06 - Théodore Bedos: So muchhhhh
15/05/2022, 23:19 - Gracou: I wish we could do silly past times together like the olympics or cards or movies or dancing in the kitchen
15/05/2022, 23:19 - Gracou: Im sick of lying down in my bed 😩
16/05/2022, 07:56 - Théodore Bedos: We will do it soon my love
16/05/2022, 07:57 - Théodore Bedos: Would you like me to write you a little sport session to do in your room? Maybe that will distract you
16/05/2022, 10:10 - Théodore Bedos: We've got a lot of nice summer dress that would fit you so well at the moment at COS
16/05/2022, 10:10 - Gracou: 🤢
16/05/2022, 10:11 - Gracou: Send pictures!
16/05/2022, 10:21 - Théodore Bedos: I am so dumb, I forgot that you were sick
16/05/2022, 10:26 - Gracou: Don’t worry x
16/05/2022, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: This one I really like the pattern but less the fit
16/05/2022, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 10:47 - Théodore Bedos: This one the fit is soo good, and we have it with blue and white stripes
16/05/2022, 10:47 - Théodore Bedos: But the model on the blue and white stripes, just stands very wierdly so it looks very bad
16/05/2022, 10:48 - Théodore Bedos: But in really it is tight on the waist and so if you have a good butt it looks amazing
16/05/2022, 10:48 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 10:48 - Théodore Bedos: Look that is such a bad shote
16/05/2022, 10:48 - Gracou: I prefer the striped version of the dress though I think
16/05/2022, 10:48 - Gracou: The plain one is a bit boring
16/05/2022, 10:48 - Théodore Bedos: I know that's what I am saying
16/05/2022, 10:49 - Gracou: But it does seem a little old
16/05/2022, 10:49 - Gracou: This would be too long for me bc I’m too short c
16/05/2022, 10:49 - Théodore Bedos: But I was showing you the plain one because the girl stands so wierdly on the striped one
16/05/2022, 10:49 - Gracou: Yeah I understand
16/05/2022, 10:51 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe, I thought too, but look the dresses stopes just before the ankle. So maybe not.
16/05/2022, 10:51 - Théodore Bedos: And the back looks great
16/05/2022, 10:51 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 10:51 - Théodore Bedos: I would have like to see you trying
16/05/2022, 10:52 - Gracou: This lady is a lot taller than me and it already finishes at her ankle x I would be standing on it
16/05/2022, 10:52 - Théodore Bedos: Yes but she is wearing a bigger size then
16/05/2022, 10:52 - Théodore Bedos: You just take a smaller one
16/05/2022, 10:52 - Gracou: I already know that it would be unflattering on me as well if u look at the back it wouldn’t work for me
16/05/2022, 10:53 - Gracou: No the length doesn’t change that much and cos always makes their stuff for tall Scandinavian people
16/05/2022, 10:53 - Gracou: Not little brits
16/05/2022, 10:53 - Théodore Bedos: Why are you so negative, I am just saying that I would like to see you trying. I have seen small people trying it and it looked great
16/05/2022, 10:54 - Théodore Bedos: It's actually a jump suit, the legs are separated but very wide so it looks like a dress. It is very cool
16/05/2022, 10:54 - Gracou: Im not against trying it I just don’t think this one would work for me
16/05/2022, 10:54 - Gracou: But it’s cool that it’s a jump suit
16/05/2022, 10:55 - Théodore Bedos: The patterned one is also very pretty
16/05/2022, 10:56 - Théodore Bedos: I just keep imagining you in one of those this summer when I see them 😍😍😍
16/05/2022, 11:15 - Gracou: Awww
16/05/2022, 11:15 - Gracou: This would be nice in Thailand
16/05/2022, 11:18 - Théodore Bedos: I just saw that on the brown one you can adjust the length of the shoulders strings
16/05/2022, 11:18 - Théodore Bedos: By quiet a lot
16/05/2022, 11:23 - Gracou: Why are you obsessed with the brown one😂
16/05/2022, 11:50 - Théodore Bedos: Because I can already see you being so gorgeous in it
16/05/2022, 11:51 - Théodore Bedos: But anyway, I have just sold the 2 last one this morning, so I doubt that there would be any XS left somewhere
16/05/2022, 11:57 - Gracou: Well done x
16/05/2022, 14:04 - Théodore Bedos: I am looking at a pair of grey sneakers for the summer, which one do you prefer?
16/05/2022, 14:04 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 14:04 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 14:04 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 14:04 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 15:09 - Gracou: Maybe the veja
16/05/2022, 15:09 - Gracou: But my veja have a hole in them so I don’t trust them anymore
16/05/2022, 15:09 - Gracou: Why don’t u get more of the rebok style ones u look so sexy in them
16/05/2022, 17:45 - Théodore Bedos: Because I already have those and another pair that is similar (that I rarely use). And   they are in leather when I am looking for some light one for the summer
16/05/2022, 18:05 - Gracou: I see
16/05/2022, 18:06 - Gracou: But they are still sexy
16/05/2022, 19:57 - Gracou: I tried to call x
16/05/2022, 20:05 - Théodore Bedos: I tried to call you back
16/05/2022, 20:23 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 20:25 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 20:26 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 20:42 - Théodore Bedos: They don't have a model wearing it on the website
16/05/2022, 20:45 - Gracou: Ah
16/05/2022, 20:45 - Gracou: Can u send the pic anyways
16/05/2022, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: It seems like this one
16/05/2022, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: But longer
16/05/2022, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: More like this one
16/05/2022, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: But tighter
16/05/2022, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: Or maybe not
16/05/2022, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/05/2022, 20:50 - Théodore Bedos: I think it is slimer, but the model is so thin that I don't know if it is because of her or because of the fit that it looks less slim
16/05/2022, 21:00 - Gracou: They look cool x
16/05/2022, 21:01 - Théodore Bedos: They will look a lot nicer on you
16/05/2022, 21:14 - Gracou: Thank you again my love ❤️ it is always so nice of you to think of me xx
16/05/2022, 21:50 - Théodore Bedos: That's very nice thank you😘😘
16/05/2022, 21:53 - Théodore Bedos: Did Sally said anything about her appartement ?
16/05/2022, 21:54 - Théodore Bedos: Because the house that I thought I had found, finally isn't working
16/05/2022, 21:55 - Théodore Bedos: Do you have any friend who have a house in Bath now that I could ask?
16/05/2022, 21:56 - Gracou: I am double checking with sally
16/05/2022, 21:56 - Gracou: Im not sure, the only person I really know that is still in bath is Tom, and he is doing the same thing and taking someone else’s room while he is on placement and won’t be out on time for you
16/05/2022, 21:56 - Gracou: He will need it in July
16/05/2022, 21:57 - Gracou: I could ask sally’s group of friends but I don’t know what their houses are like or where they are
16/05/2022, 21:57 - Gracou: Since I’m 3rd year everyone is on placement at the moment and not in bath
16/05/2022, 22:02 - Théodore Bedos: I just need something for now, it's in 3 weeks and I have nothing...
16/05/2022, 22:02 - Théodore Bedos: Can you please ask?
16/05/2022, 22:02 - Gracou: I will ask toby
16/05/2022, 22:05 - Gracou: When do u need it until?
16/05/2022, 22:11 - Théodore Bedos: 5th of June to 5th of august
16/05/2022, 22:36 - Gracou: Toby is gunna ask everyone to see what he can do
16/05/2022, 22:36 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you babe
16/05/2022, 22:36 - Gracou: Of course
16/05/2022, 22:49 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my love😘😘😘
16/05/2022, 22:53 - Gracou: Baby please can you request the number of the landlord lady
16/05/2022, 22:53 - Gracou: I would really like to speak with her
17/05/2022, 10:16 - Gracou: How is my sexy baby’s morning going
17/05/2022, 13:10 - Théodore Bedos: I have asked baby
17/05/2022, 13:10 - Gracou: Thank you
17/05/2022, 13:14 - Théodore Bedos: I understand that you really like this appartement but make less a fixation about it.
It is colder, it is further from a supermarket, it doesn't have a dish washer, you'll not have a landlord that let you ride his horse every week...
Also it is not fair to Tom that has just sent us the contract yesterday. And not nice to Jim and Elena that end up having to bother their landlord

27/05/2022, 13:50 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
27/05/2022, 15:45 - Théodore Bedos: I would have loved it baby, but I can't
27/05/2022, 15:45 - Gracou: That’s okay I understand x
27/05/2022, 18:16 - Théodore Bedos: Have you asked the klaudia's friend
27/05/2022, 18:16 - Théodore Bedos: ?
27/05/2022, 18:18 - Gracou: This is what I was calling to tell u about earlier
27/05/2022, 18:18 - Gracou: He has told Claudia that he doesn’t want to rent the room
27/05/2022, 18:18 - Gracou: But I will see what I can do
27/05/2022, 19:07 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf??

27/05/2022, 21:21 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
27/05/2022, 21:22 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
27/05/2022, 22:35 - Théodore Bedos: No that doesn't work it's too short. But it's not important, I would have time to find something else for a week. What's more important is the address and the price. But anyway the landlady is probably just gonna say no
27/05/2022, 22:37 - Théodore Bedos: I have contacted the guy for the other option I had, which was far and expensive. But I told him that we could have a win win deal were he doesn't have an empty room this summer and I get to pay less. So he asked me how much would I like. I said 400 bills included. And he said that it was reasonable so he will answer me Sunday because he is being best man at a wedding
27/05/2022, 22:38 - Gracou: Okay that’s good news
27/05/2022, 22:38 - Gracou: Annoying that it’s far away
27/05/2022, 22:43 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah let's hope that he doesn't change his mind
27/05/2022, 23:41 - Gracou: Yes hopefully

01/06/2022, 15:43 - Théodore Bedos: What does that mean
01/06/2022, 16:59 - Gracou: This is an English expression it’s like saying you want to be on holiday
01/06/2022, 16:59 - Gracou: ‘I’m ready to be done with this’ doesn’t actually mean you’re done it just means you want to be done
01/06/2022, 17:23 - Gracou: Eat dinner without me baby
01/06/2022, 17:44 - Théodore Bedos: Oh nooo

01/06/2022, 21:01 - Gracou: I made an even worse mistake when I realised I was on the wrong train that made the whole thing take way longer than if I had just gone all the way back to the first place and started again

04/06/2022, 20:30 - Gracou: Okay

05/06/2022, 22:56 - Théodore Bedos: I mean what were the activities?
06/06/2022, 09:21 - Gracou: It was more people, less structured and a little less wholesome I guess
06/06/2022, 09:21 - Gracou: More like you just arrive and you start drinking and keep drinking
06/06/2022, 09:21 - Gracou: I just didn’t sleep until it was light outside and then I was freezing when I tried to sleep bc I didn’t have a blanket

06/06/2022, 14:22 - Théodore Bedos: Yes

06/06/2022, 16:46 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
06/06/2022, 16:46 - Gracou: Apparently he made someone uncomfortable
06/06/2022, 16:46 - Gracou: It wasn’t me that said anything so I’m v curious
06/06/2022, 16:54 - Théodore Bedos: Karma
06/06/2022, 16:58 - Gracou: I’m wondering which other girl he makes uncomfortable 😂
06/06/2022, 17:51 - Théodore Bedos: I am sure your being annoyed not to be the only one that he made advances to
06/06/2022, 17:52 - Gracou: Actually not at all
06/06/2022, 18:37 - Théodore Bedos: Good then
06/06/2022, 18:37 - Théodore Bedos: I am finally done with cleaning the appartement
06/06/2022, 18:38 - Théodore Bedos: I have done so many unexpected tasks!!!!
06/06/2022, 18:38 - Théodore Bedos: And I am not happy with Wiktoria's work at all. She clearly didn't do anything at 100%
06/06/2022, 18:53 - Gracou: I agree darling
06/06/2022, 18:53 - Gracou: It seems like she lightly wiped stuff but didn’t properly clean it
06/06/2022, 18:53 - Gracou: What else did you find that she didn’t do?
06/06/2022, 18:54 - Gracou: Also Wiktoria is Eastern European so she deffo knows how to clean properly so it makes me think she just wasn’t that bothered
06/06/2022, 19:36 - Théodore Bedos: For example she said that she did the microwave, clearly she didn't do the inside, neither the back of it. She did not even lived it to clean the table because there was a lot of mess under it
06/06/2022, 19:37 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

06/06/2022, 19:57 - Théodore Bedos: I am making an investment, I 1m paying 15 pounds for flowers and luckily it wil save me more than 15 pounds on the rent
06/06/2022, 20:00 - Gracou: Yes I think it’s a good plan

07/06/2022, 15:53 - Théodore Bedos: I want to see you and my family but it's my only week without anything to do since Christmas and I don't really want to spend it in the train or the plane
07/06/2022, 15:55 - Gracou: I really want to see you my love but maybe you should see your family
07/06/2022, 15:55 - Gracou: Since I’m working there will be lots of time I can’t spend properly with you

07/06/2022, 17:10 - Théodore Bedos: I was hesitating between coming to see you for a night then take the plane to Paris or just seeing you or just seing them or staying here.
07/06/2022, 17:10 - Théodore Bedos: If I come see you what am I gonna do all day when you are working?

Let me know if you need more bank details.
10/06/2022, 15:43 - Gracou: Okay babe
10/06/2022, 15:43 - Gracou: So I only need to pay half?
10/06/2022, 15:44 - Théodore Bedos: No, this is the half
10/06/2022, 15:45 - Gracou: Babe that’s 1000 a month then
10/06/2022, 15:45 - Gracou: That isn’t what you told me
10/06/2022, 15:45 - Gracou: Well a little less that 1000 but still
10/06/2022, 15:45 - Théodore Bedos: It's 800 something. It's what I told you, we had this discussion a few times.
10/06/2022, 15:46 - Théodore Bedos: It's like paying 612 bills included on 12 months.
10/06/2022, 15:50 - Théodore Bedos: I know it's expensive if you look at it monthly but if you think look at it over the year. And compare with a 12 months accomodation that would be empty over the summer it's pretty cheap for what it is.
10/06/2022, 18:00 - Théodore Bedos: What's the activity planning in Ireland?
10/06/2022, 18:23 - Gracou: At the moment we have just looked around and are having a rest while people arrive x

13/06/2022, 19:51 - Gracou: Thanks babe
13/06/2022, 20:36 - Gracou: How was your first day?
13/06/2022, 21:24 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
13/06/2022, 21:27 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
13/06/2022, 21:27 - Théodore Bedos: Why is Andy dressed as a German tourist at a James bond party?
13/06/2022, 21:27 - Gracou: Hahahahaha
13/06/2022, 21:27 - Gracou: That’s hilarious
13/06/2022, 21:27 - Gracou: He doesn’t have a suite

13/06/2022, 21:28 - Théodore Bedos: Fair enough
13/06/2022, 21:28 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks baby

13/06/2022, 21:30 - Théodore Bedos: Joe I don't know, but Andy I can understand because when you do a lot of gymming go at our age you just constantly change weight and it is just not worth to buy a suit if you can war it only once
13/06/2022, 21:30 - Gracou: Yeah fair
13/06/2022, 21:30 - Gracou: Joe has shit trousers and a shirt which is good enough for most events

14/06/2022, 18:49 - Théodore Bedos: You would be a very good looking Portuguese or Spanish man baby
14/06/2022, 19:04 - Gracou: I didn’t think I was very good looking as a man honestly
14/06/2022, 19:14 - Théodore Bedos: You look like my friend nur
14/06/2022, 19:16 - Théodore Bedos: I couldn't find. Apicture
14/06/2022, 19:16 - Théodore Bedos: a picture
14/06/2022, 19:16 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
14/06/2022, 19:16 - Théodore Bedos: What do you think of me?
14/06/2022, 19:24 - Gracou: Cute
14/06/2022, 21:29 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
14/06/2022, 21:29 - Théodore Bedos: So good looking
14/06/2022, 21:29 - Théodore Bedos: I'm gonna start a fake tinder account
14/06/2022, 22:40 - Gracou: Ew babe 🤢
14/06/2022, 22:40 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
14/06/2022, 22:41 - Gracou: Did you ask Ashley about staying at hers? Xo it would be great to know as I will need to pack tomorrow if I need to come to bath
14/06/2022, 22:57 - Théodore Bedos: Yes babe I just asked her. She came back every day pretty late and so I couldn't ask her. And so today I have been waiting all evening that she goes to the kitchen so that I could ask her
14/06/2022, 22:57 - Théodore Bedos: She is letting me stay so I'll come to London
14/06/2022, 23:07 - Théodore Bedos: But the thing is that Friday I'll have a presentation to do in person at work so I'll have to leave late. Whereas if I would come in 2 weeks I would be able to take maybe Friday and/or Monday from home and so I could come to London Friday and/or Monday as well. Which I cannot do now. 
So maybe it could be nice if we swapped? But of course it's my turn to come so you decide what you think we should do
15/06/2022, 10:18 - Théodore Bedos: I miss you a lot by the way. I was thinking if the face you make when you ruching on something and your nose holes open big and it made me melt inside.
15/06/2022, 10:18 - Gracou: Yayyyyyy
15/06/2022, 10:20 - Gracou: I wouldn’t be able to work from home on the Friday or the Monday in two weeks darling so you would be in my apartment alone x
15/06/2022, 10:20 - Gracou: When I’m ruching on something?
15/06/2022, 10:29 - Théodore Bedos: Rushing
15/06/2022, 10:29 - Théodore Bedos: When you make your big eyes and big nose holes
15/06/2022, 10:29 - Théodore Bedos: And tight lips
15/06/2022, 10:30 - Gracou: What would I be rushing?
15/06/2022, 10:31 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
15/06/2022, 11:02 - Théodore Bedos: Yes 🥰🥰🥰🥰
15/06/2022, 11:06 - Gracou: 😇😇😇
15/06/2022, 11:55 - Gracou: It would be better for me to come to bath in two weeks as I need to pick up the cash to pay tom with and deliver it in person, but I won’t have the cash by this weekend x
15/06/2022, 13:14 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you want to pay him in Cash???
15/06/2022, 13:15 - Gracou: We can talk about it later
15/06/2022, 13:15 - Gracou: But I didn’t expect it to be the 1st of July so that’s the only way we can pay, half card half cash
15/06/2022, 16:10 - Théodore Bedos: Oh wow, I didn't know that it would be that hard for you
15/06/2022, 16:11 - Théodore Bedos: Did you ask Tom if could do something about it?
15/06/2022, 16:12 - Gracou: My dad has been spending lots of money recently, so he didn’t prepare for that beforehand as we didn’t know
15/06/2022, 16:12 - Gracou: Tom said it’s fine
15/06/2022, 18:19 - Théodore Bedos: Baby when I said "did you ask Tom if he could do something about it" I am not asking you if you asked him if he is ok to take cash.
I am asking this, as if maybe he could be okay to give you a later deadline so that you have more time to find the sum.
15/06/2022, 18:19 - Gracou: Well we have the money it’s just some of it’s in cash
15/06/2022, 18:20 - Gracou: Why do you seem angry?
15/06/2022, 18:21 - Théodore Bedos: I am really not baby, I am saying this so that you know that I am with you if you want to ask Tom to have more time
15/06/2022, 18:24 - Gracou: It’s okay
16/06/2022, 01:27 - Gracou: Sleep well my love

17/06/2022, 16:59 - Gracou: Omg

20/06/2022, 14:42 - Théodore Bedos: By the way, now I see why you took so long. It's because you were taking pictures while the 20 persons were queuing
20/06/2022, 14:42 - Théodore Bedos: Just talking about it with someone from the uni at work
20/06/2022, 14:43 - Gracou: They were very quick pictures

21/06/2022, 10:42 - Gracou: Okay good x
21/06/2022, 22:56 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my love

25/06/2022, 00:49 - Gracou: Wait I can’t listen rn I will tell you what I think soon xo
25/06/2022, 14:12 - Théodore Bedos: Someone important at work send me an invitation to a web develloper conference. I didn't feel like it was good to say no so I am spending my Saturday from 8:30 to 5 at the conference in Bristol
25/06/2022, 14:12 - Gracou: Today?
25/06/2022, 14:12 - Gracou: Is it good?
25/06/2022, 14:13 - Théodore Bedos: And she only sent it to me, so when I asked none of the other student said they would come
25/06/2022, 14:13 - Théodore Bedos: Yes today
25/06/2022, 14:13 - Gracou: Is it fun
25/06/2022, 14:13 - Théodore Bedos: The first one made me feel extremely lost, the second 2 were actually quiet intresting
25/06/2022, 14:13 - Théodore Bedos: And the food at lunch was super nice
25/06/2022, 14:13 - Gracou: Are you glad you went?
25/06/2022, 14:14 - Théodore Bedos: There was baklava!!!
25/06/2022, 14:14 - Gracou: Is the important lady there?
25/06/2022, 14:14 - Gracou: !!!!
25/06/2022, 14:14 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, but I am writing for the last 2 hours to confirm
25/06/2022, 14:15 - Théodore Bedos: Also I have put my name in 3 lotteries and I can win a switch, an applewatch or a coffee machine
25/06/2022, 14:20 - Théodore Bedos: And there are around a 100 people so I might actually get a chance to get it
25/06/2022, 14:20 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
25/06/2022, 14:21 - Théodore Bedos: It's nice but not sure I would have not préfèr to rest
25/06/2022, 14:58 - Gracou: Ooooh!

25/06/2022, 17:14 - Théodore Bedos: I won a bonzai tree lego
25/06/2022, 17:14 - Théodore Bedos: And a smart Alexa
25/06/2022, 17:18 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
25/06/2022, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: I used 3 devices and different addresses to enter my name multiple time in the lottery.

So they called 4 time in total. Theodore, Theo, Bedos, and Théodore Bedos
25/06/2022, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: So I just took my price the first time and then I pretended not to be there it was very awkward
25/06/2022, 17:20 - Théodore Bedos: So they called me 4 time but not first so I couldn't get the apple watch nor the switch
25/06/2022, 17:29 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
25/06/2022, 17:39 - Théodore Bedos: I don't think so. I'll ask though.
Eventually my room will be free but that's not even sure in September as I might need it faster Thailand.
And even if I did not need it I have never heard my parents ever mentioning renting a room even for joking.
25/06/2022, 17:40 - Théodore Bedos: But I'll ask, maybe they know someone
25/06/2022, 18:27 - Gracou: No no I wouldn’t expect them to let her live in your house that would probably be weird haha
25/06/2022, 22:47 - Théodore Bedos: Where did you play golf?
25/06/2022, 22:49 - Théodore Bedos: I forgot that you were in Bournemouth

26/06/2022, 00:35 - Gracou: I miss you too❤️
26/06/2022, 00:35 - Gracou: It was just mini golf xxx
26/06/2022, 18:07 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué

27/06/2022, 10:55 - Théodore Bedos: Best dog
27/06/2022, 18:15 - Théodore Bedos: Worst day of my life, I have lost my father's watch
27/06/2022, 18:15 - Théodore Bedos: I had it yesterday at the work drink and I just can't find it this morning
27/06/2022, 18:16 - Théodore Bedos: I have zero memory of taking it off
27/06/2022, 18:16 - Théodore Bedos: And there is no way that someone would have stole it from me because my ring is missing too
27/06/2022, 18:16 - Théodore Bedos: So there must be together somewhere
27/06/2022, 19:34 - Gracou: I have already seen this video
27/06/2022, 19:35 - Gracou: Clearly the dog wasted lots of time barking, and then didn’t even help bc just weighed the man down
27/06/2022, 19:36 - Gracou: No this is the worst news
27/06/2022, 19:36 - Gracou: You must have put it down somewhere
27/06/2022, 19:36 - Gracou: Check in the house etc
27/06/2022, 20:13 - Théodore Bedos: Not sure a golden retriever would have done anything at all. Barking is good it alerts people
27/06/2022, 20:14 - Théodore Bedos: And then he is not adding weight on the person he is helping him
27/06/2022, 20:14 - Théodore Bedos: I have checked everywhere, I am devastated
27/06/2022, 20:15 - Gracou: https://youtube.com/shorts/mBjH5DG19R4?feature=share
27/06/2022, 20:16 - Gracou: https://youtu.be/EKzUdRE0xBc

27/06/2022, 20:48 - Gracou: I’m sure you will. Find it x
27/06/2022, 20:48 - Gracou: Maybe it is with your airpods
27/06/2022, 20:56 - Théodore Bedos: I am not laughing babe, I am really desperate
27/06/2022, 21:56 - Théodore Bedos: I found it
27/06/2022, 22:19 - Gracou: I’m so relieved
27/06/2022, 22:19 - Gracou: Sorry darling
27/06/2022, 22:19 - Gracou: Where did u find it
27/06/2022, 22:26 - Théodore Bedos: It was in my shoe

28/06/2022, 08:11 - Théodore Bedos: A little, but clearly not that much
28/06/2022, 08:11 - Théodore Bedos: Only had 5 pints
28/06/2022, 08:12 - Théodore Bedos: Over 6h
28/06/2022, 08:15 - Gracou: Then why your shoe!
28/06/2022, 08:19 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe because I had many stuff to carry from the kitchen to my room after having dinner. And so I put them in so that I could carry more at once
28/06/2022, 08:19 - Théodore Bedos: Have you been practising your french?
28/06/2022, 10:10 - Gracou: I am just about to practice my french now actually x

28/06/2022, 20:20 - Théodore Bedos: I just had a pack of pork cracklings, and I really wished you were there to attack my lips right after I finished it
28/06/2022, 21:11 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
28/06/2022, 21:11 - Gracou: Look at my lovely pasta bake

28/06/2022, 21:59 - Théodore Bedos: I miss it too
28/06/2022, 21:59 - Théodore Bedos: You haven't answered me
28/06/2022, 22:00 - Gracou: I haven’t decided my love
28/06/2022, 22:00 - Gracou: It was too cheesy but that would be probably a good thing for you
28/06/2022, 22:00 - Théodore Bedos: Tell me what you are hesitating between
28/06/2022, 22:34 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
28/06/2022, 22:38 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
28/06/2022, 22:39 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
28/06/2022, 22:49 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
29/06/2022, 19:11 - Théodore Bedos: Can't wait to be with you my love
29/06/2022, 19:18 - Gracou: Me too darling xx
29/06/2022, 19:32 - Théodore Bedos: Have you done some french today?
29/06/2022, 20:47 - Gracou: I had to stand on the train today so not yet but I will try before dinner xo
29/06/2022, 22:03 - Gracou: How was your day my love x
29/06/2022, 22:43 - Théodore Bedos: Not the very best
29/06/2022, 22:44 - Théodore Bedos: I have to prepare the final project with a girl called Jaime. And we add an argue today
29/06/2022, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: His dad works for a finance company and we have to make a finance/technology stratup so she asked him some ideas. And now of course she can only think that her dads ideas is good.
29/06/2022, 22:48 - Théodore Bedos: Which his the case, it is a good idea. But it is very complex. So I can't understand it fully, and she is not even able to explain it to me correctly when I ask her specific questions. So clearly we are not going to be a le to master it in 4 weeks. And we will just look stupid when the CEO of seccl and Octupus, who knows a lot, will ask us very specific questions.
29/06/2022, 22:48 - Théodore Bedos: But because it's her dad idea she thinks it is genius
29/06/2022, 22:49 - Théodore Bedos: And the worst is that I am sure that she does not even understand what she is trying to explain me.
29/06/2022, 23:14 - Gracou: Do you think you wouldn’t understand it in four weeks?
30/06/2022, 08:14 - Théodore Bedos: Understand maybe, being able to master the concept and develop a prototype to present in front of 2 CEO, clearly not
30/06/2022, 09:31 - Gracou: Okay darling
30/06/2022, 09:31 - Gracou: Have u got a developed idea to tell her? Or can u ask her to get her dad to explain it to you?
30/06/2022, 12:39 - Théodore Bedos: I am proposing to create a card for couples, that allows you to split the bills automatically based on a percentage that you can quickly set up on an app.

The cool thing would be that you wouldn't have to put money on the card. The card would directly split the payment and send the 2 payment on each of the personal cards.

So let say we agree that I should pay for 60% of our shopping and you 40% because I have more expensive food. When we pay with the card it would charge automatically your personal card with 40% of the shopping
30/06/2022, 12:40 - Théodore Bedos: For example if we are at the restaurant. I could pay with the card and seem like I am paying for everything in front of the waiter. But the card would automatically split it 50/50 without the waiter knowing.
30/06/2022, 12:41 - Théodore Bedos: It would save from the faf of having to pay twice for a specific amount and then a second time
30/06/2022, 14:26 - Théodore Bedos: We have a bit of an issue. I just learned that Ashley's mum is staying at the house until I will leave.
30/06/2022, 14:29 - Théodore Bedos: Should we go to Devon? I was thinking I could come to London again maybe, as you said that you wanted to profit of London as much as possible.
30/06/2022, 14:30 - Théodore Bedos: But I wanted to go play some tennis with you outside
30/06/2022, 14:30 - Théodore Bedos: And also I don't really want to use my weekend of rest, not being able to sleep because Mike is partying.
30/06/2022, 15:02 - Gracou: Let me think about it
30/06/2022, 15:31 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks for the massive enthousiasme on my startup idea
30/06/2022, 15:40 - Gracou: It’s a good idea
30/06/2022, 15:41 - Gracou: I’m thinking about the Devon idea
30/06/2022, 18:06 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
30/06/2022, 18:06 - Gracou: Hey babe
30/06/2022, 18:07 - Gracou: I’m just gunna check with my parents but I think Devon sounds like a nice idea and we could go to the beach as well x
30/06/2022, 18:53 - Théodore Bedos: No they are not doing it this weekend, they will do it next Friday. So let's go to Devon
30/06/2022, 18:58 - Gracou: Okay it will still be a very nice weekend xx
30/06/2022, 20:12 - Théodore Bedos: Sure it will
30/06/2022, 20:59 - Théodore Bedos: When do you think you'll arrive in Devon?
30/06/2022, 20:59 - Gracou: Not entirely certain yet my love x
30/06/2022, 21:00 - Théodore Bedos: Estimation please
30/06/2022, 21:00 - Théodore Bedos: I need to take my train ticket
30/06/2022, 21:00 - Gracou: I really don’t know x maybe 10/11

01/07/2022, 21:32 - Théodore Bedos: Just finished my MacDonald
01/07/2022, 21:33 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
01/07/2022, 21:35 - Théodore Bedos: I knew you would
01/07/2022, 21:35 - Théodore Bedos: I initially wanted to say, I had a MacDonald like you
01/07/2022, 21:36 - Théodore Bedos: We're connected baby
01/07/2022, 22:49 - Gracou: ❤️❤️
03/07/2022, 19:53 - Théodore Bedos: Are you watching Intouchables?
03/07/2022, 19:53 - Théodore Bedos: I did and I really really wish I was cuddling you while watching
03/07/2022, 21:24 - Gracou: I did not I read my book because the service was bad xxx
03/07/2022, 21:24 - Gracou: But it would have been very nice to watch and cuddle together
03/07/2022, 23:36 - Gracou: I hope you are home safe x sleep well
04/07/2022, 07:54 - Théodore Bedos: I am
04/07/2022, 07:54 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry for not asking you, if you were home safe
04/07/2022, 12:22 - Gracou: Don’t worry my love
04/07/2022, 12:22 - Gracou: I missed your cuddles last night x
04/07/2022, 13:03 - Théodore Bedos: I did too
04/07/2022, 19:33 - Théodore Bedos: I am watching a movie, where it's Ben Stiller who just got married and quit his wife during their honeymoon. Then he find in love with another one
04/07/2022, 23:03 - Théodore Bedos: Bad news, the host of the Airbnb did not confirm our reservation so it got cancelled.
04/07/2022, 23:04 - Théodore Bedos: So I found us another one. It's 165 each instead of 141,50 for the other one. But it is 5/5 stars rating and it seems super great.
I can still cancel so let me know if you are ok
04/07/2022, 23:06 - Théodore Bedos: Also, then they proposed some activities in Bangkok. And one of them was a Thai cooking class for couples. I would love to do that with you!!
04/07/2022, 23:50 - Gracou: Okay so the same movie we watched before
04/07/2022, 23:50 - Gracou: Enaaaaat noooo
04/07/2022, 23:51 - Gracou: Im sure it’s fine if you picked it baby but can I see pictures?
04/07/2022, 23:51 - Gracou: If it makes you happy 💕 although we ‘cook together’ all the time and you don’t find me very useful x
04/07/2022, 23:54 - Gracou: Im also curious - did elena and Jim’s landlord decide whether she was going to sell the apartment
05/07/2022, 07:21 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, he told me 4 days ago, that she is selling
05/07/2022, 07:22 - Théodore Bedos: I will
05/07/2022, 07:22 - Théodore Bedos: Nope, because this time he falls in love with Jennifer Aniston
05/07/2022, 07:26 - Théodore Bedos: Découvrez ce logement sur Airbnb ! https://www.airbnb.fr/rooms/43663420?check_in=2022-08-29&check_out=2022-09-04&guests=1&adults=2&s=13&unique_share_id=832cd0ec-c34d-4886-9ee7-9df240d2fd33
05/07/2022, 08:05 - Gracou: Happy one year and four months ❤️❤️
05/07/2022, 08:10 - Théodore Bedos: Happy 1 year and 4 months🥰🥰🥰
Even more in love with you every day
05/07/2022, 08:13 - Gracou: ❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘 me too darling xx
05/07/2022, 08:13 - Gracou: It sounds exactly the same 😂😂😂
05/07/2022, 08:13 - Gracou: Okay good this makes me feel better
05/07/2022, 08:16 - Théodore Bedos: To be honest it is a little different.
He get married, they go in honeymoon at the beach, and she cheat on him the first day. He quit her, go back to NY and he meet Jennifer Aniston a week after. But then the wife come back and he hesitate between them a bit.
 So it's a bit different. But really not that much
05/07/2022, 08:35 - Théodore Bedos: Apparently in the new Airbnb they have anti light curtain. So we will sleep super good. That's good because in Thailande you have a lot of light very early
05/07/2022, 10:16 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
05/07/2022, 11:09 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry baby but the long middle line doesn't mean anything
05/07/2022, 11:10 - Théodore Bedos: You are saying:
You have me give your facturation 17/06/22. So, your payment is on top of the  17/06/22. Don't worry
05/07/2022, 11:12 - Théodore Bedos: And you are using tu to speak to her, that's quiet informal, especially if your re saying don't worry with it. It feels like you should use vous. Ne vous inquiétez pas
05/07/2022, 11:12 - Théodore Bedos: What are you trying to say with the middle sentence?
05/07/2022, 11:42 - Théodore Bedos: Did you try to say?:
You gave me you facturation on the 17/06. So, your payment will be proceed the 17/07. 

If yes, you should say:
Vous m'avez donné votre facturation le 17/06. Donc, votre paiement sera effectué le 17/07.
05/07/2022, 12:44 - Gracou: That isn’t a very nice response :(
05/07/2022, 13:19 - Théodore Bedos: Why? I am trying to help you so that you sound professional to the person.
05/07/2022, 13:21 - Théodore Bedos: What's not very nice, is that I sent you a very long and complete message so that you can correct your email asap. And you answer not answering my questions and saying that it is not nice
05/07/2022, 13:21 - Théodore Bedos: That's a bit ungrateful
05/07/2022, 13:31 - Gracou: Theo it’s a bit rude to straight away say what’s wrong rather than at least being supportive of me trying :(
05/07/2022, 13:32 - Gracou: You answered an hour after anyway so clearly I would have sent the email already so it’s just a bit unecessary
05/07/2022, 13:33 - Gracou: Of course I will make mistakes, but I thought I would try and I was proud of myself for making the effort
05/07/2022, 13:55 - Théodore Bedos: Baby, of course I am happy that you are trying and a lot or things are good in your email. 
But as you sent it for work, I thought it was quiet urgent for me to let you know that the tone of the email is inappropriate for a business email and that the message was unclear. So that you can correct it.
Because saying to someone "ne t'inquiète pas" can be badly taken. And I don't want it to backfire on you.
05/07/2022, 13:56 - Gracou: Yes I thought the don’t worry could be a bit too familiar
05/07/2022, 13:56 - Gracou: But this is someone I have spoken with for months already which is why I felt comfortable to try
05/07/2022, 13:57 - Théodore Bedos: Would you consider sending another email to clarify it?
05/07/2022, 21:41 - Gracou: Sorry for not answering properly I have been very busy today
06/07/2022, 00:27 - Gracou: Sleep well baby
06/07/2022, 09:18 - Théodore Bedos: Just to recap babe, could you transfer me 165 for the Airbnb and 15 for your book. So 180.
06/07/2022, 09:19 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
06/07/2022, 09:28 - Gracou: Okay I have sent it
06/07/2022, 09:28 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you baby
06/07/2022, 09:29 - Gracou: Why are you being so blunt? And not wishing me a good morning or good night?
06/07/2022, 09:30 - Théodore Bedos: I am not 😂 sorry if you felt like it
06/07/2022, 09:31 - Théodore Bedos: You know I lack of English courtesy skills to ask people things. I see now how it can be abrupt to ask money 1st thing in the day
06/07/2022, 10:50 - Gracou: Thanks theo
06/07/2022, 12:20 - Gracou: I’m going to miss you lots over the next few weeks!
06/07/2022, 12:39 - Théodore Bedos: Me too my love
06/07/2022, 12:40 - Théodore Bedos: When are you living?
06/07/2022, 12:40 - Théodore Bedos: Leaving
06/07/2022, 12:51 - Gracou: Friday evening
06/07/2022, 12:51 - Gracou: But I am staying in Bristol on Friday evening and leaving very early in the morning
06/07/2022, 13:04 - Théodore Bedos: Why are you staying in Bristol? You could come stay at mine and take the early bus. It's just 45min from Bath to the airport
06/07/2022, 15:08 - Gracou: Darcy and I are staying together
06/07/2022, 15:09 - Gracou: I think my mum too
06/07/2022, 15:09 - Gracou: Actually no just darcy and I
06/07/2022, 15:21 - Théodore Bedos: Where about? When is your flight?
06/07/2022, 15:21 - Gracou: I’m not sure x
06/07/2022, 15:23 - Théodore Bedos: It's very quick and easy to go from Bath. If Darcy can stay by herself one night, I'd be very happy to have before you leave
06/07/2022, 15:23 - Théodore Bedos: *To have you
06/07/2022, 15:24 - Gracou: We need to go to the airport together x
06/07/2022, 15:39 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
06/07/2022, 15:40 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe you could just get an hotel in Bath both of you rather than Bristol?
06/07/2022, 15:47 - Gracou: Theo it’s already booked
06/07/2022, 15:47 - Gracou: Because my mum has organised it and paid for it?!
06/07/2022, 16:32 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I didn't know that!
06/07/2022, 16:33 - Gracou: Of course it is already booked!
06/07/2022, 16:33 - Gracou: It’s 2 days before
06/07/2022, 16:33 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't think too much about it
06/07/2022, 16:33 - Gracou: And you have been sat next to me multiple times while my mum told me she booked it
06/07/2022, 16:33 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't pay attention
06/07/2022, 16:34 - Théodore Bedos: And I was just asking why you had to go together. Not why you have to go to Bristol
06/07/2022, 16:34 - Gracou: Bc we have to go at 5am and it’s already organised
06/07/2022, 16:35 - Théodore Bedos: Babe calm
06/07/2022, 16:35 - Théodore Bedos: If you would have just told me that from the beginning it would have been faster
06/07/2022, 16:36 - Gracou: It’s just logical Theo :/
06/07/2022, 16:38 - Théodore Bedos: Babe stop being agressive like that
06/07/2022, 16:39 - Gracou: I’m not theo I just feel like you often ask lots of questions about things like this when they are already planned
06/07/2022, 16:40 - Gracou: It’s very blunt
06/07/2022, 16:40 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't know it was paid before. And even if it is already paid why would be such a problem if you came to bath and met your sister at the airport. I will pay for your bus ticket if really that's an issue
06/07/2022, 16:40 - Gracou: No
06/07/2022, 16:40 - Gracou: It’s about making the whole thing simple and not ditching my sister
06/07/2022, 16:42 - Théodore Bedos: I was just asking, chill out
06/07/2022, 16:43 - Gracou: It’s just that you often do it and your tone is very blunt when you ask it
06/07/2022, 16:48 - Théodore Bedos: Baby, I was just trying to see if there was any possibility for us to not not see each other for a month. It was from a good attention.
Now if you wanna go this way, I personally feel quiet annoyed that when I am trying to find a solution for us to see each other you deny them all like if that was the last thing you wanted.
06/07/2022, 17:14 - Gracou: No baby I want to see you too
06/07/2022, 17:14 - Gracou: But if u go up u can see it started fine and I said no it’s not possible
06/07/2022, 17:15 - Gracou: And then u didn’t let it go and kept asking many many times in different ways
06/07/2022, 17:15 - Gracou: I would come see you if I thought it was possible
06/07/2022, 17:46 - Théodore Bedos: What about me coming to Bristol? We could have a nice dinner together
06/07/2022, 17:46 - Théodore Bedos: When would you be arriving?
06/07/2022, 18:39 - Gracou: Yes I would love for you to come to Bristol ❤️
06/07/2022, 18:39 - Gracou: I will try to see if it is possible for me to work on the train to arrive earlier
06/07/2022, 20:06 - Théodore Bedos: It would be nice❤️
06/07/2022, 22:07 - Théodore Bedos: Where will you stay in Bristol?
06/07/2022, 22:28 - Théodore Bedos: Good night my beautiful
07/07/2022, 09:25 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
07/07/2022, 09:41 - Théodore Bedos: Oh shite!!!! Your not saying in Bristol you are staying in the airport
07/07/2022, 09:41 - Théodore Bedos: I don't how how we could do then
07/07/2022, 09:41 - Théodore Bedos: Also babe, Raj is ok to buy your swimwear with the discount
07/07/2022, 09:42 - Théodore Bedos: Do you know which size was the bottom?
07/07/2022, 09:42 - Gracou: My train will go to Bristol though
07/07/2022, 09:42 - Gracou: And I can get an Uber to the hotel
07/07/2022, 09:42 - Gracou: ❤️❤️❤️
07/07/2022, 09:57 - Théodore Bedos: And for the swimwear?
07/07/2022, 10:00 - Gracou: I will leave the swimwear just for now xx
07/07/2022, 10:00 - Théodore Bedos: Oh really but they were so good on you. And you need some anyway, no?
07/07/2022, 10:01 - Gracou: Im just going to wait until after Croatia and decide if I want it
07/07/2022, 10:04 - Théodore Bedos: Now I am gonna look stupid, saying that finally we don't want to buy it or maybe later
07/07/2022, 10:29 - Gracou: I told you I didn’t want to spend the money though theo
07/07/2022, 10:29 - Gracou: And you saw I bought a different bikini
07/07/2022, 10:30 - Gracou: I don’t think it will make u look stupid
07/07/2022, 11:47 - Théodore Bedos: Which one?
07/07/2022, 12:00 - Théodore Bedos: Oh the one you showed me in Devon? I thought Darcy or your Mom gave it to you
07/07/2022, 12:01 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway, just let me know before I ask
07/07/2022, 12:01 - Théodore Bedos: xx
07/07/2022, 13:24 - Gracou: I thought you would let me know before you asked since that makes much more sense
07/07/2022, 13:24 - Gracou: When we spoke about it last u seemed like u didn’t much want to ask
07/07/2022, 13:50 - Théodore Bedos: Because I am like that, I don't like to ask for services. So I took a bit of time to ask and then Raj took ages to answer me.
07/07/2022, 13:50 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway no big deal
07/07/2022, 13:50 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
07/07/2022, 13:50 - Théodore Bedos: New panache video, I love it
07/07/2022, 13:51 - Théodore Bedos: And he made a ref to Dragonball so I love it even more
07/07/2022, 15:54 - Gracou: It looks good x
07/07/2022, 15:55 - Gracou: Yes no big deal darling c
08/07/2022, 01:44 - Théodore Bedos: Did you get the authorisation to work in the train tommorow? If yes, when should I come ?
08/07/2022, 09:38 - Gracou: I’m not 100% certain
08/07/2022, 09:39 - Gracou: I didn’t have the right time to ask Harry so im going to try to sneak into the train anyway
08/07/2022, 09:39 - Théodore Bedos: Aha alright
08/07/2022, 09:39 - Gracou: Bc Harry has already let me have more days off than im allowed so I don’t want to be rude
08/07/2022, 09:40 - Gracou: So my plan will probably be last minute
08/07/2022, 09:42 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
08/07/2022, 12:07 - Gracou: It’s a bit tough bc it is looking like I have quite a lot of work but I’m doing my best x
08/07/2022, 12:27 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks babe
08/07/2022, 12:28 - Théodore Bedos: Do you know what you would like to do in Bristol?
08/07/2022, 12:41 - Théodore Bedos: Please try to get one of these 2 train because I didn't took any sport cloth with me. If you arrive at 8 I'll have 2h where I can't do anything
08/07/2022, 12:45 - Gracou: Wait are you already in Bristol
08/07/2022, 12:45 - Gracou: Theo I will try my best but I have a lot of work today and I don’t think I can do it on the train actually
08/07/2022, 12:45 - Gracou: Trust that I’m doing my best to come see you x
08/07/2022, 12:53 - Gracou: My Birkenstock are also arriving today so I need to make sure I get them x
08/07/2022, 13:03 - Théodore Bedos: Are you working from home?
08/07/2022, 13:06 - Théodore Bedos: No I am at the office in Bath. If you arrive at 5:30, 6:00 items fine because I can stay a bit longer at the office and then take the train. But if you arrive at 8, I am not gonna stay 2/3h by myself in the office. And I don't have sport clothes so I can't go gymming. So it would be quiet complicate for me
08/07/2022, 13:07 - Gracou: Okay well just know I’m doing my best but there is a lot going on x
08/07/2022, 13:08 - Théodore Bedos: I understand
08/07/2022, 13:08 - Théodore Bedos: Are you working from home?
08/07/2022, 14:47 - Gracou: Yes x
08/07/2022, 15:30 - Théodore Bedos: How is it going?
08/07/2022, 15:42 - Gracou: Not so well x
08/07/2022, 15:43 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
08/07/2022, 15:54 - Théodore Bedos: Aren't they too big??
08/07/2022, 15:54 - Théodore Bedos: Babe are you on the way to the train?
08/07/2022, 15:55 - Gracou: My mum says to keep them that size
08/07/2022, 15:55 - Gracou: I’m not babe I still have work to do sorry x
08/07/2022, 16:00 - Gracou: I will still try to get there but maybe you should go home as I can’t promise to be quick enough
08/07/2022, 16:04 - Théodore Bedos: What's the reason behind that? I wouldn't like to be floating that much in open shoes
08/07/2022, 16:05 - Théodore Bedos: I am disappointed
08/07/2022, 16:53 - Gracou: I am waiting for a very big file to upload and then I can leave
08/07/2022, 17:59 - Théodore Bedos: I think we should cancel babe. We should have been together by now, but I don't even know if you've left your house. I have already been waiting 2h30 by myself in the office
08/07/2022, 18:04 - Gracou: I will be arriving at 8:07
08/07/2022, 18:07 - Gracou: Theo why did u wait there when u knew I couldn’t get the train at 4? U could have gone home then come back out to see me :(
08/07/2022, 18:08 - Théodore Bedos: I live 20 min away from the train station. That's 40 min walking back and forth
08/07/2022, 18:19 - Gracou: Do you have other plans tonight?
08/07/2022, 18:26 - Théodore Bedos: Not anymore
08/07/2022, 18:51 - Gracou: Okay bc so you are literally doing nothing anyway why not visit me?
08/07/2022, 18:51 - Théodore Bedos: Because its a lot of effort for seeing you 1h
08/07/2022, 19:00 - Gracou: Okay
08/07/2022, 19:00 - Théodore Bedos: Also I am very annoyed. Tell my why should I go through all this effort to come see you, when you just did not bother to make me wait 2h30
08/07/2022, 19:00 - Gracou: I was working theo a and had lots to do bc I’m taking ten days off and I couldn’t leave before
08/07/2022, 19:01 - Gracou: I told you i had lots to do and I didn’t think I would make the train
08/07/2022, 19:02 - Théodore Bedos: You were working from home, you could have just done the same in the train
08/07/2022, 19:04 - Théodore Bedos: And look at this, it makes me feel like you just don't care. It would just make me feel so much better if you could just say something like "please, can you come" or "oh no I really wanted to see you". But instead you just go Okay
08/07/2022, 19:15 - Gracou: No because I would have to bring all of my work stuff on the plane and my bag is too heavy
08/07/2022, 19:16 - Gracou: Because you don’t want to come! And I tried to make you see that you are being silly but I’m not going to argue with you if your choice is to not come
08/07/2022, 19:16 - Gracou: You are entitled to not come if you don’t want to
08/07/2022, 19:17 - Gracou: I changed my plans and got here as quick as I could, but that doesn’t mean you should hear an ear full from me for cancelling
08/07/2022, 19:17 - Gracou: It’s not worth it to argue over it, so I just accept your judgement
08/07/2022, 19:18 - Gracou: Very hypocritical of you to get angry at me for not saying something with tonnes of extra flowery words.
08/07/2022, 19:18 - Gracou: I have a lot of patience with you on that
08/07/2022, 19:18 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
08/07/2022, 19:19 - Gracou: As an example
08/07/2022, 19:30 - Théodore Bedos: Grace I know you. You are so excited of wearing your new shoes in Croatia that they could 5 size too small you would still wear them. 
So I was just trying to accentuate it a bit so that you realise it. Because what's gonna happen is that you are gonna wear them, and then you won't be able to return them and in 2 weeks you are gonna complain about them like the veja because they don't fit you
08/07/2022, 19:30 - Théodore Bedos: I was just trying to spare you this
08/07/2022, 19:48 - Gracou: Well it’s not very enjoyable to hear
08/07/2022, 19:49 - Gracou: I put my foot on the size chart and it says that I’m wearing the right size
08/07/2022, 19:49 - Gracou: But I think that’s it’s too big
08/07/2022, 19:49 - Gracou: So my mum has said that she will just buy them off me bc she really likes them if I think they aren’t the right size in 2 weeks
08/07/2022, 19:51 - Gracou: I will miss you whilst I’m away
09/07/2022, 00:01 - Théodore Bedos: Are you arrived?
09/07/2022, 00:02 - Gracou: Yes my love
09/07/2022, 00:02 - Gracou: Are you
09/07/2022, 00:02 - Gracou: Goodnight darling x
09/07/2022, 00:14 - Théodore Bedos: I am
09/07/2022, 00:14 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my love
09/07/2022, 00:19 - Gracou: ❤️❤️❤️
09/07/2022, 06:39 - Gracou: I love you x
09/07/2022, 07:15 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/07/2022, 10:01 - Théodore Bedos: It's not a real plane that you are in right?
09/07/2022, 10:10 - Gracou: It’s real
09/07/2022, 10:11 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/07/2022, 10:51 - Théodore Bedos: That's the plane that you have flight in?
09/07/2022, 12:48 - Gracou: Yes
09/07/2022, 13:27 - Théodore Bedos: How come?
09/07/2022, 13:30 - Gracou: They invited us up
09/07/2022, 13:30 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
09/07/2022, 13:30 - Gracou: The flight was delayed
09/07/2022, 14:52 - Théodore Bedos: Did they let other people go?
09/07/2022, 16:30 - Gracou: Yes they let children in😂
09/07/2022, 17:05 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know if I like it much that the plane staff consider you as a kid...
09/07/2022, 17:06 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway, that's amazing that you have been able to visit a cockpit
09/07/2022, 19:16 - Théodore Bedos: Send me pictures when you will arrive my love 🥰😍🥰
09/07/2022, 19:16 - Théodore Bedos: I already miss you a lot
09/07/2022, 20:20 - Gracou: No we just came up also and made a joke about being a bit taller than their other visitors
09/07/2022, 20:20 - Gracou: Im very tired
09/07/2022, 20:20 - Gracou: Ive been in a cockpit before actually
09/07/2022, 20:20 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/07/2022, 20:20 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/07/2022, 20:21 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/07/2022, 20:21 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/07/2022, 20:22 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/07/2022, 20:22 - Théodore Bedos: Lovely
09/07/2022, 20:22 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/07/2022, 20:22 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/07/2022, 20:22 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/07/2022, 20:23 - Gracou: It took so long to get here
09/07/2022, 20:23 - Gracou: Also when I was in the cockpit I stood up and banged my head really hard on the roof
09/07/2022, 20:28 - Théodore Bedos: Are you ok?
09/07/2022, 20:28 - Gracou: Yes I’m okay x
09/07/2022, 20:28 - Théodore Bedos: Did you push some button when you hit your head
09/07/2022, 20:28 - Théodore Bedos: ?
09/07/2022, 20:28 - Gracou: I am a bit surprised though bc actually the hotel is quite small and we normally stay at quite large resorts
09/07/2022, 20:28 - Gracou: I think so
09/07/2022, 20:29 - Théodore Bedos: So needy
09/07/2022, 20:31 - Théodore Bedos: It seems very nice. If Darcy wants to leave before the end to go in Italy, let me know. I'll happily come to spare her from this little hotek
09/07/2022, 20:31 - Théodore Bedos: Aha
09/07/2022, 20:34 - Gracou: Hahaha
09/07/2022, 20:34 - Gracou: She has decided to stay the hill whole time but it would be a very romantic place to stay
09/07/2022, 20:34 - Gracou: But bc it is so small I think you would be very bored
09/07/2022, 20:35 - Théodore Bedos: I am never bored when I am with you
09/07/2022, 20:49 - Gracou: I love you
09/07/2022, 22:54 - Gracou: Goodnight my love
09/07/2022, 23:37 - Théodore Bedos: Good night sun of my life❤️😘😘😘
09/07/2022, 23:37 - Théodore Bedos: You are lucky to not be at your appartement this week end because it is absolutely boiling here
10/07/2022, 09:19 - Gracou: Yes it must be way too hot in there
10/07/2022, 09:19 - Gracou: ❤️❤️❤️
10/07/2022, 12:39 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
10/07/2022, 12:53 - Théodore Bedos: So sexy!!!!
10/07/2022, 13:17 - Gracou: Thanks baby
10/07/2022, 13:23 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you have a neckless around your waist?
10/07/2022, 13:29 - Gracou: It’s a thing people do
10/07/2022, 13:39 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe I have seen it in Aladin
10/07/2022, 14:46 - Gracou: Exactly and Jasmine looked very cool
10/07/2022, 22:07 - Théodore Bedos: I got myself a skateboard today. There was some deals at the shop. I went to the skatepark and I am pretty trash.
10/07/2022, 22:14 - Gracou: Show me a picture!!
10/07/2022, 22:14 - Théodore Bedos: It's not pretty
10/07/2022, 22:14 - Théodore Bedos: I took the only one that was on sale and that was my size
10/07/2022, 22:15 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
10/07/2022, 22:41 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight most gorgeous woman in the planet😘😘
10/07/2022, 22:41 - Théodore Bedos: On the planet
10/07/2022, 23:11 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
11/07/2022, 09:50 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
11/07/2022, 09:50 - Théodore Bedos: Look at the big piece of skin that I reaped of by opening my shaker of whey this morning!
11/07/2022, 10:07 - Gracou: No baby!
11/07/2022, 10:07 - Gracou: Ouch
11/07/2022, 14:25 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
11/07/2022, 16:05 - Théodore Bedos: Babe !! You need suncream

11/07/2022, 16:10 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, no monokini to make it even!!
11/07/2022, 16:11 - Théodore Bedos: Unless, it's very very dark and you have water up to the neck
11/07/2022, 16:11 - Gracou: No I think I will take my bikini top off tomorrow to make it even
11/07/2022, 16:11 - Gracou: I saw a woman do it yesterday
11/07/2022, 16:12 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

11/07/2022, 18:05 - Gracou: Should I get a gift for your mum here? What kind of thing would she like?
11/07/2022, 20:46 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
11/07/2022, 21:25 - Théodore Bedos: Was he a customer of the restaurant?
11/07/2022, 21:26 - Théodore Bedos: You could get something for my mum, but they won't be in Paris when you arrive. So it will be complicate to carry it all the way to Thailand.
11/07/2022, 21:26 - Théodore Bedos: But surely she appreciate that sorts of effort
11/07/2022, 21:26 - Gracou: What would you think would be good to get her/your dad
11/07/2022, 21:58 - Théodore Bedos: No clue
11/07/2022, 21:59 - Théodore Bedos: My mum quiet liked last time when you got her a pretty shell
11/07/2022, 21:59 - Théodore Bedos: It can't be food because you are not gonna carry food all the way to Thailand
11/07/2022, 23:31 - Gracou: Obviously
11/07/2022, 23:31 - Gracou: Hmm I will have a think
12/07/2022, 09:16 - Théodore Bedos: Don't worry to much about it. Worst case scenario you'll get her wine gums
12/07/2022, 09:33 - Gracou: Okay baby x

13/07/2022, 19:55 - Gracou: Noooo ewww
13/07/2022, 19:55 - Gracou: Not the bag
13/07/2022, 21:06 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
13/07/2022, 21:26 - Gracou: Sorry for seeming a bit distracted x
13/07/2022, 22:45 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
13/07/2022, 22:46 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
13/07/2022, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
13/07/2022, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: Because he looks sad?
14/07/2022, 11:23 - Théodore Bedos: Do you remember those boots that I was hesitating with when I ordered my sand boots at Christmas? They are the same than the one I have but in different leather and colour.
14/07/2022, 11:23 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
14/07/2022, 11:23 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
14/07/2022, 11:23 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
14/07/2022, 11:24 - Théodore Bedos: I really really liked them but because I already had dark shoes and boots I took the sand one.
14/07/2022, 11:25 - Théodore Bedos: I found someone selling them on vinted, brand new. And I negotiated them for 190euro instead of 329 in shops.

17/07/2022, 21:44 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
17/07/2022, 21:44 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
17/07/2022, 21:45 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
17/07/2022, 23:45 - Théodore Bedos: It is like 35 in my room, jt's awfull
18/07/2022, 00:09 - Gracou: Noooo
18/07/2022, 00:10 - Gracou: I have just had the thought that after we come back from Thailand I could do a french immersion course in Paris or something to learn French
18/07/2022, 00:10 - Gracou: Obviously I would need to be able to afford it first but what do you think of the idea
18/07/2022, 09:00 - Théodore Bedos: Like a daily class for 2/3h every morning?
18/07/2022, 09:01 - Théodore Bedos: I did that once for a week in England when I was 16 and it really helped me feeling less shy I'm English
18/07/2022, 09:02 - Théodore Bedos: I think it is a good idea, but it will be expensive and we also have many many things to do like Disneyland
18/07/2022, 09:03 - Théodore Bedos: We will discuss it when you come on Tuesday
18/07/2022, 09:06 - Théodore Bedos: One thing you can do now, is to register for the french classes at uni. It's free, it's just 1h30 a week and it would teach you properly the grammar.
But they are very few places and it get sold out very quickly, so have a look now
18/07/2022, 09:41 - Gracou: Thats true
18/07/2022, 09:42 - Théodore Bedos: I found a private teacher with who you could do 2h every day from Monday to Friday, for 540€ so 450£ approximately.
18/07/2022, 09:42 - Théodore Bedos: It seems really good
18/07/2022, 09:43 - Gracou: I found one that would be for 499€
18/07/2022, 09:46 - Théodore Bedos: Is it this one?
18/07/2022, 09:46 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
18/07/2022, 09:47 - Théodore Bedos: It seems great. 499 for 2 weeks. Mine was just 1 week
18/07/2022, 09:54 - Théodore Bedos: It's not far from where I live
18/07/2022, 10:09 - Gracou: Yes I think that was the one :)
18/07/2022, 10:09 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
18/07/2022, 10:10 - Théodore Bedos: I think you have the level above
18/07/2022, 10:10 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
18/07/2022, 10:10 - Gracou: It says I should have a gcse 😂
18/07/2022, 10:11 - Théodore Bedos: It's good I think, you would be in a group as well.
18/07/2022, 10:11 - Théodore Bedos: And you can also do just one week for 250
18/07/2022, 10:11 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
18/07/2022, 10:11 - Théodore Bedos: 250 euros, so 200 pounds. We could do it before going to Thailand so that you feel confident to speak with my parents
18/07/2022, 10:11 - Gracou: Ah that’s good
18/07/2022, 10:12 - Gracou: Yes maybe
18/07/2022, 10:13 - Théodore Bedos: I think that if you do one of the classes this summer you will easily be able to do this level
18/07/2022, 10:14 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway, they do interviews before accepting you in. So you can just try and she will tell you yes or no
18/07/2022, 10:14 - Théodore Bedos: I think you you will be fine, and you have a private teacher at home to help you if it's hard don't forget
18/07/2022, 10:14 - Gracou: Definitely
18/07/2022, 11:09 - Théodore Bedos: I could get a gym membership near by. So I would bring you to the classes in the morning, go gymming and meet you again when you'll be done.
18/07/2022, 12:47 - Gracou: Ooo that could be fun
18/07/2022, 12:47 - Gracou: I need to work out if I have the money first x
18/07/2022, 12:48 - Gracou: <Médias omis>

21/07/2022, 20:45 - Gracou: Yes and I don’t think I received an email or anything x
21/07/2022, 20:45 - Théodore Bedos: Don't forget to ask your dad for the budgeting baby
21/07/2022, 20:46 - Théodore Bedos: It is very soon, and their might be very few places for the french course that we found
21/07/2022, 23:21 - Gracou: Yes I had a chat with my dad and he says he is going to think about it but he thinks the french course is a good idea so I’m safe to book it!

22/07/2022, 18:52 - Gracou: Womannn woman womannnnnn
22/07/2022, 21:13 - Théodore Bedos: I am watching a rom comedy with Bradley cooper, Jennifer Aniston, Scarlett Johanson, Ben Affleck, the girl from top gun and more!!! What a cast!!
22/07/2022, 21:30 - Théodore Bedos: I think we would laugh a lot of we were watching it together
22/07/2022, 21:53 - Théodore Bedos: Noooo, Bradley Cooper is looking to cheat on the top gun girl with Scarlett's Johanson!!!! Not nice
22/07/2022, 22:35 - Théodore Bedos: I guess you are out, have a good evening. I am going to bed
23/07/2022, 00:42 - Gracou: Hi baby sorry Tom arrived and we watched a movie xx
23/07/2022, 00:43 - Gracou: I should watch this
23/07/2022, 00:43 - Gracou: I still haven’t watched the French movie
23/07/2022, 00:43 - Gracou: Hope you are sleeping well❤️
23/07/2022, 10:50 - Gracou: ❤️ morning sunshine x
23/07/2022, 10:57 - Théodore Bedos: Good morning my love
23/07/2022, 10:57 - Théodore Bedos: I think it was a really good movie
23/07/2022, 10:58 - Théodore Bedos: Quiet touching, and very accurate
23/07/2022, 11:44 - Gracou: Don’t worry darling
23/07/2022, 11:45 - Théodore Bedos: I don't like that

How would you feel if I was watching a serie in my bed with Wiktoria????
23/07/2022, 11:45 - Gracou: I don’t have a sofa darling
23/07/2022, 11:46 - Gracou: We aren’t even touching
23/07/2022, 11:46 - Gracou: Opposite sides of the bed
23/07/2022, 11:47 - Théodore Bedos: It doesn't matter
23/07/2022, 11:48 - Théodore Bedos: I am very chill with may things, like you giving your number when guys ask you, or you going on a date with Isaac, but that's just wrong babe to be watching a serie in your bed with a guy that you know has a crush on you babe.
23/07/2022, 11:48 - Théodore Bedos: *Many things
23/07/2022, 11:49 - Théodore Bedos: I am not happy with it
23/07/2022, 11:51 - Gracou: The connection isn’t working
23/07/2022, 11:52 - Gracou: Babe
23/07/2022, 12:08 - Gracou: They are now talking about it in the kitchen bc mike overheard :(
23/07/2022, 12:13 - Théodore Bedos: Talk with them. I don't think there is anything to be shame of.
23/07/2022, 12:15 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I have values that I really care of, loyalty, honesty, respect, trust. Respect is very very important to me, and this was just to my opinion really disrespectful to me.
23/07/2022, 12:16 - Gracou: I would never disrespect you
23/07/2022, 12:17 - Théodore Bedos: I know babe, and I am sure you didn't mean too by doing this.
23/07/2022, 12:18 - Gracou: Just to be clear is this how you would feel about it with all of my friends or just Tom
23/07/2022, 12:19 - Théodore Bedos: But it's how I feel and that's why I can't accept it. If they want to think that I am controlling, I don't care. But I know to that you care about what they think. So I would recommend that you just tell them openly how I see it
23/07/2022, 12:20 - Théodore Bedos: Especially with Tom yes. Because he has a crush on you, because he stroke you, because he has made you feel uncomfortable.
23/07/2022, 12:21 - Théodore Bedos: But I would not like it either if it was other boys
23/07/2022, 12:21 - Gracou: Okay
23/07/2022, 12:21 - Gracou: I just want to be on the same page
23/07/2022, 12:22 - Théodore Bedos: If it was other boys I would just not like it a lot but not be pissed at them, just at you. Because I know Tom and he knows me, I found it very disrespectful. It's quiet insulting
23/07/2022, 12:22 - Gracou: Okay
23/07/2022, 12:26 - Gracou: Just so you know I went over to watch love island with Adam earlier in the week and normally we would watch it in the living room but this time he said let’s watch it in his room. To be honest, I didn’t like the idea since there was a living room but I didn’t want to make the situation weird and uncomfortable with his flatmate there so we sat in his room. I decided afterwards that I didn’t think it was right or necessary and that If he ever asked again I would say no.
23/07/2022, 12:26 - Gracou: I just want you to know x
23/07/2022, 12:26 - Gracou: But with Tom I thought it would be okay since there was no other option but of course I just won’t do it again at all
23/07/2022, 12:27 - Gracou: Are you okay babe? It says u went online then went off again
23/07/2022, 12:30 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I am a bit speechless
23/07/2022, 12:30 - Gracou: Im really sorry babe if it upsets you x
23/07/2022, 12:31 - Gracou: Can you please talk to me about it?
23/07/2022, 12:34 - Gracou: Would you like me to call you?
23/07/2022, 12:36 - Théodore Bedos: Babe imagine I had been meeting Emily with no one else from Cos around without telling you. 

Now imagine that I had been meeting her several time at her house to watch a quiet sexual program like live island.

Now imagine that we did it in her room.

And now imagine that I did all of that but did not bother telling you once about it

How would you feel?
23/07/2022, 12:36 - Gracou: Im not sure
23/07/2022, 12:36 - Gracou: I trust you
23/07/2022, 12:37 - Gracou: Im really sorry that this has broken your trust
23/07/2022, 12:38 - Théodore Bedos: I trust you too babe, but should I still trust you now that I know that you've been hiding this from me.
23/07/2022, 12:38 - Gracou: I wasn’t hiding it darling
23/07/2022, 12:39 - Gracou: I didn’t think it mattered so much as it was a decision I made in my head to create a boundary, but I mentioned it now that you said this is something very important to you and makes you feel disrespected
23/07/2022, 12:39 - Gracou: Bc then I felt if I didn’t mention it I would be hiding something
23/07/2022, 12:41 - Théodore Bedos: Babe you were annoyed, the one time I told you that I had a very fun discussion for an hour with wiktoria in the kitchen. And I told you about it in the same evening. 
How many step passed that, is what you have been doing?
23/07/2022, 12:42 - Gracou: I see your point
23/07/2022, 12:42 - Gracou: It won’t happen again
23/07/2022, 12:42 - Gracou: Admittedly Wiktoria is a lot prettier than adam though
23/07/2022, 12:43 - Théodore Bedos: You said the same thing with Isaac
23/07/2022, 12:43 - Gracou: That was very different darling
23/07/2022, 12:45 - Gracou: Im not sure what to say bc I don’t want to make lots of excuses and make you feel crazy for being upset
23/07/2022, 12:45 - Gracou: I understand why you are upset
23/07/2022, 12:45 - Gracou: And I understand that this would break your trust
23/07/2022, 12:46 - Gracou: I didn’t think of it in the way that you put it, and I will try to do better to think of it in that way
23/07/2022, 12:46 - Gracou: Bc just bc I think it’s innocent doesn’t mean it feels nice for you
23/07/2022, 12:46 - Gracou: And I don’t want to make you fe el bad
23/07/2022, 12:46 - Gracou: But just know also that I’m not interested in anyone else than you
23/07/2022, 12:47 - Gracou: And I also have stopped feeling that need to to feel attractive thing just so you don’t think I’m leading people on
23/07/2022, 12:48 - Gracou: Im not interested in adam or Tom or any of my friends or anyone I know I just love being with you
23/07/2022, 12:48 - Gracou: And no one is prettier or nicer
23/07/2022, 12:52 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
23/07/2022, 12:53 - Gracou: Are you okay darling is there anything I can do?
23/07/2022, 12:54 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks babe. I appreciate that you understand how I feel and that you don't think I am unreasonable. It made more upset when on the phone you seemed to think I had been unreasonable. 
I know I am a bit old school with this sort of things and I don't have many femal friend, so I try to be understanding, more than what I would usually accept. I know that we have different view on this but so I just hopped that you would tell me about this sort of things before it happens or at least soon after. Rather than me discovering it after
23/07/2022, 12:55 - Gracou: Okay baby i understand
23/07/2022, 12:56 - Gracou: I suppose I just don’t think to tell u as it happens if we don’t chat about my day or whatever but I will do this more in the future x
23/07/2022, 12:56 - Théodore Bedos: I really trust you babe, and I don't feel threatened. It's a matter of respect and empathy, I wished that you would understand how it could make me feel more when it happens.
23/07/2022, 12:57 - Gracou: I know that you are very trusting it’s just I don’t want everyone to think that our relationship has lots of red flags bc if they don’t support you then it makes it difficult for me
23/07/2022, 12:57 - Gracou: Of course darling
23/07/2022, 12:57 - Gracou: I will let you know
23/07/2022, 12:58 - Gracou: Thank you for being understanding that I wasn’t purposely hiding something
23/07/2022, 12:58 - Théodore Bedos: I am happy to be on the same page.
23/07/2022, 12:58 - Gracou: Are you still upset?
23/07/2022, 12:59 - Théodore Bedos: less
23/07/2022, 12:59 - Gracou: Okay baby
23/07/2022, 12:59 - Gracou: I love you

27/07/2022, 10:07 - Théodore Bedos: I'd love to give you one
27/07/2022, 10:10 - Théodore Bedos: I played ping pong with Jim and went to the sauna. Then I thought we would go have joint and play some FIFA at his. But he thought we would just smoke a joint outside and chat for a bit and then split. So it was very nice but I was a bit sad not to have a proper last lad evenning before he leaves.
27/07/2022, 10:10 - Théodore Bedos: The I went home and I have a too much food. So not soo good in the end

27/07/2022, 10:57 - Gracou: You said you wanted to play games
27/07/2022, 10:57 - Théodore Bedos: I said that I thought we would  go to Jim's house have a joint and okay games
27/07/2022, 10:57 - Théodore Bedos: Play*
27/07/2022, 10:58 - Théodore Bedos: But he thought we would just have one outside and then go back home separately

28/07/2022, 01:30 - Gracou: They didn’t answer my email so far I was also worried
28/07/2022, 01:29 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
28/07/2022, 01:45 - Gracou: Appel vidéo manqué
28/07/2022, 08:20 - Théodore Bedos: Did you had a problem babe? You called me at nearly 2am
28/07/2022, 08:20 - Théodore Bedos: !!
28/07/2022, 10:00 - Gracou: I wanted to talk to you❤️
28/07/2022, 10:00 - Gracou: I was very drunk I just also woke up drunk
28/07/2022, 10:00 - Gracou: But I’m safe
28/07/2022, 10:00 - Gracou: Bea and lukas looked after me
28/07/2022, 11:04 - Théodore Bedos: Wow, I have really seen you like this
28/07/2022, 11:04 - Théodore Bedos: Rarely*
28/07/2022, 11:05 - Théodore Bedos: Hope you had a nice night
28/07/2022, 11:38 - Théodore Bedos: I need your help
28/07/2022, 11:39 - Théodore Bedos: What would you say is the average price for an influencer and how many clicks does it brings you
28/07/2022, 11:39 - Théodore Bedos: Don't need to be super precise just an estimation
28/07/2022, 11:39 - Gracou: It was really nice but it turns out I don’t remember a lot of it
28/07/2022, 11:39 - Gracou: Why do you need to know x
28/07/2022, 11:40 - Gracou: And there isn’t an average it varies way too much
28/07/2022, 11:40 - Théodore Bedos: For the marketing part of my startup
28/07/2022, 11:40 - Théodore Bedos: Just give me an estimation, please
28/07/2022, 11:40 - Gracou: I can’t it doesn’t exist let me think what else could be helpful
28/07/2022, 11:41 - Théodore Bedos: If you pay 1000 pounds to an influencer, how many leads should you expect?
28/07/2022, 11:41 - Gracou: Like the link clicks and price for someone with 10k followers is obviously extremely different to someone with 10 million
28/07/2022, 11:41 - Gracou: It depends on how good the influencer is
28/07/2022, 11:41 - Théodore Bedos: In average
28/07/2022, 11:41 - Gracou: You’re not really understanding how it works
28/07/2022, 11:42 - Théodore Bedos: I understand how it works
28/07/2022, 11:42 - Gracou: Give me a minute to try to find something helpful for you
28/07/2022, 11:42 - Théodore Bedos: Just look at the last influencers that you paid and tell me how many view did his post
28/07/2022, 11:42 - Théodore Bedos: I don't need more
28/07/2022, 11:49 - Gracou: You were being a bit mean
28/07/2022, 11:50 - Théodore Bedos: I know
28/07/2022, 11:51 - Théodore Bedos: I know you job is more complex than what I asked, but I just needed any random data to have a little idea of the market. And I don't think that it needed that much discussion to get it
28/07/2022, 11:52 - Gracou: I was trying to help you and I said give me a minute to try to find something and you kept pushing which wasn’t necessary
28/07/2022, 11:52 - Gracou: You don’t need to talk to me like that while I’m trying to help you
28/07/2022, 11:53 - Gracou: And as I said, you asked for something that doesn’t exist and can’t be calculated, so I was trying to find the closest thing I could
28/07/2022, 11:55 - Théodore Bedos: What other channel does you company use?
28/07/2022, 11:55 - Théodore Bedos: Would you say that influencer is the most effective?
28/07/2022, 11:55 - Gracou: Seriously you’re going to keep asking for more information without saying sorry?
28/07/2022, 12:01 - Théodore Bedos: I am sorry to have not been very patient and so to have talk to you rudely. But 2 things, first I don't like to talked to like a dummy. I can make the difference between Cost per view, Click through ratio, CAC, convention rate etc.... And even if I don't I can Google it. I just wanted any real data from you. Second, I am pretty stressed right now because I have a million things to do before presenting to the CEOs. I just wanted something quickly, and you just kept telling me that you couldn't help which wasn't true.
L
28/07/2022, 12:02 - Théodore Bedos: So I am sorry to have talked to you rudely but right now I just need some help
28/07/2022, 12:03 - Gracou: I told you I needed 5 mins to find something helpful
28/07/2022, 12:03 - Gracou: I was looking for the data that I eventually gave you the whole time
28/07/2022, 12:04 - Gracou: Im sorry you’re stressed but that doesn’t mean you need to be rude
28/07/2022, 12:05 - Gracou: We use tiktok, YouTube, Facebook, email marketing, insert marketing, ugc, spark ads etc etc
28/07/2022, 12:05 - Gracou: Influencer makes a lot of money and has made the company grow extremely quickly
28/07/2022, 12:05 - Gracou: But there are lots of effective marketing channels
28/07/2022, 12:06 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you very much
28/07/2022, 12:06 - Théodore Bedos: That's very helpful
28/07/2022, 12:07 - Théodore Bedos: By user generated content, do you mean referrals?
28/07/2022, 12:07 - Théodore Bedos: What sort of content does décorent user do?
28/07/2022, 12:07 - Théodore Bedos: Deodorant
28/07/2022, 12:08 - Gracou: We do do referrals and affiliate marketing too I forgot about that
28/07/2022, 12:09 - Gracou: But user generated content can be organic so we don’t pay them we just send them stuff and then we will often just ask them if we can put paid spend behind it to get it to more people
28/07/2022, 12:10 - Gracou: Lots of stuff, it depends on the platform but the important thing is to communicate the usps. A lot of the time talking about personal experience is very good for conversions eg ‘Im allergic to normal deodorant so this works best for me bc it has Shea butter which is rlly kind to my skin’ or ‘I have menopause and this has been the best deodorant I have found while all my hormones are changing bc there are no nasties’
28/07/2022, 12:12 - Théodore Bedos: What is paid spend?
28/07/2022, 12:14 - Gracou: I just explained
28/07/2022, 12:14 - Gracou: It’s paying to have the content reach more people as an ad
28/07/2022, 12:15 - Gracou: Social media ads have paid spend behind them and the more you pay the more people will see it
28/07/2022, 12:15 - Théodore Bedos: Alright thanks
28/07/2022, 12:16 - Gracou: Im still not very happy w u
28/07/2022, 12:18 - Théodore Bedos: I call you in a bit
28/07/2022, 12:22 - Gracou: Just focus on work for now I just wanted to let you know x
28/07/2022, 13:11 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
28/07/2022, 13:11 - Gracou: Are you okay?
28/07/2022, 13:11 - Gracou: Don’t be stressed we don’t need to talk about it now
28/07/2022, 13:12 - Gracou: Focus on what you need to focus on
28/07/2022, 13:12 - Gracou: Im not angry at you
28/07/2022, 13:19 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I just wanted to talk with you during my lunch break
28/07/2022, 13:44 - Théodore Bedos: https://open.spotify.com/track/3Cx4yrFaX8CeHwBMReOWXI?si=nr_-ukDGTv2hX9qix5T-UA&utm_source=whatsapp
28/07/2022, 13:44 - Théodore Bedos: I've got this in my head since yesterday evening
28/07/2022, 13:44 - Gracou: It’s not loading now I will listen later x
28/07/2022, 13:44 - Théodore Bedos: I really want to listen to it very very loud with you while jumping frenetically
28/07/2022, 13:54 - Gracou: Frantically*
28/07/2022, 13:54 - Gracou: That sounds fun
28/07/2022, 14:19 - Théodore Bedos: Have listened to it?
28/07/2022, 20:41 - Théodore Bedos: How much of the boys have you watched?
28/07/2022, 20:47 - Gracou: I haven’t
28/07/2022, 20:51 - Théodore Bedos: I thought you eat he'd some with Tom?
28/07/2022, 20:53 - Gracou: Not very much, we had only just started it when you called
28/07/2022, 20:54 - Théodore Bedos: Oh ok
28/07/2022, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: Because I had just started to watch the first episode the day before
28/07/2022, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: I am on season 2 now, I really like it
28/07/2022, 21:21 - Gracou: That nice
28/07/2022, 21:21 - Gracou: J am very addicted to breaking bad but I might get into the boys more after
28/07/2022, 21:22 - Théodore Bedos: Which season are you on in breaking bad?
28/07/2022, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: If you manage to finish breaking bad we could watch better call Saul together after. Someone at work told me that he thinks it is even better than breaking bad.
28/07/2022, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: And it would make my dad super happy because it's his favourite serie
28/07/2022, 21:39 - Gracou: Yes I want to start watching it
28/07/2022, 21:39 - Gracou: And the breaking bad movie
28/07/2022, 21:51 - Théodore Bedos: There is a movie???
28/07/2022, 21:51 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't know
28/07/2022, 21:52 - Théodore Bedos: You didn't answer
28/07/2022, 22:15 - Gracou: I have been with my mum having dinner
28/07/2022, 22:15 - Gracou: I am on s3
28/07/2022, 22:15 - Gracou: Yes
28/07/2022, 22:15 - Gracou: It’s apparently very good
28/07/2022, 22:15 - Gracou: If u wait we can watch it together
28/07/2022, 22:16 - Théodore Bedos: Definitely
28/07/2022, 22:16 - Théodore Bedos: Your mom is in London?

28/07/2022, 22:18 - Gracou: That’s American it’s mum
28/07/2022, 22:18 - Gracou: And yes
28/07/2022, 22:18 - Gracou: She had a meeting today she is staying for two nights

30/07/2022, 18:07 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
30/07/2022, 18:07 - Gracou: I think it looks lots better than before I can tell you have worked hard on it well done
30/07/2022, 18:07 - Gracou: I think it’s a really viable business idea and would make a great start up
30/07/2022, 18:08 - Gracou: If I were you for your presentation, I would create a short poll quiz asking whether people would want to use an app like this and include it in your ppt
30/07/2022, 18:11 - Gracou: Just saw a German shepherd mixed with a golden retriever!
30/07/2022, 18:11 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
30/07/2022, 18:11 - Gracou: Empty flat
30/07/2022, 18:12 - Gracou: Or 10p charge on top
30/07/2022, 18:12 - Gracou: Did you consider making the app subscription based rather than a charge for every payment?
30/07/2022, 18:35 - Gracou: What are you going to do with all of your things when we go to france?
30/07/2022, 19:33 - Théodore Bedos: It's explained later, there are cashbacks and you can share subscriptions
30/07/2022, 19:34 - Théodore Bedos: What would make a download link unique?
30/07/2022, 19:35 - Gracou: You can have a unique generator but anyway u could just renonce the word unique the phrasing is just a bit Better
30/07/2022, 19:36 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it does. If you don't use the card you don't pay anything because we charge per transaction. And if you do a lot of transaction there is a camping system so that we never charge more than 3pounds a month in total. So it is free to use if you have use it a lot.
30/07/2022, 19:36 - Gracou: Im saying that the way you explain it doesn’t
30/07/2022, 19:36 - Gracou: You should explain it like that and then put the free if u use it a free if you use it a lot thing after the explanation
30/07/2022, 19:37 - Gracou: Theo you don’t have to take my advice you just asked for my opinion
30/07/2022, 19:37 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it's a new feature of online banks, that give you a card with codes that can be used only once. So you can use it as your paying method for a free trial and be sure to never get charged when the free trial is over because the card doesn't exist anymore
30/07/2022, 19:38 - Gracou: You should explain this too as someone who doesn’t know a lot about finance stuff like me wouldn’t understand it
30/07/2022, 19:40 - Théodore Bedos: Babe it's a landing page not a website. It has to be super lean so that people stay focus on the only thing we want them to do. Give their email, it would be explained in the website
30/07/2022, 19:41 - Théodore Bedos: I am just trying to understand why you don't understand it.
30/07/2022, 19:41 - Théodore Bedos: Babe don't get defensive straight away. I appreciate a lot of the things you said
30/07/2022, 19:42 - Théodore Bedos: Except when you asked if I considered a subscription. I found that quiet offencing
30/07/2022, 19:42 - Gracou: That was just a curiosity question, not because I think you should
30/07/2022, 19:42 - Gracou: It has to be understandable to the people who are going to use it too though
30/07/2022, 19:42 - Gracou: Im not getting defensive I felt that it was the other way around
30/07/2022, 19:50 - Théodore Bedos: Also I forgot to edit it. But Just the design is final. I haven't edited the text yet. Si for example 10p per transaction is not our model. We will charge by rounding payment. So we pay something for 9.40. It's rounded to 10pounds and we are both charged 30p.
We thought it is a great model, because contrary to subscription for example, if  you don't use the card it costs you nothing. Also it feels like you are not paying much because it goes 20p per 20p, whereas a 5pound subscription seems quiet expensive for not having to transfer money manually
30/07/2022, 19:50 - Théodore Bedos: Also rounding is quiet a unique revenue model, it should create interest and curiosity a around the brand
30/07/2022, 19:50 - Théodore Bedos: I am not either babe, I really valuate your advices
30/07/2022, 19:52 - Théodore Bedos: I am thinking of renting a storage place. But I have contacted them and they said it would cost me 200 pounds so I am checking the other options. 
Also I will struggle a lot bringing all my stuff alone to the storage place in Oldfield. I am thinking if taking a trolley at Sainsbury's
30/07/2022, 19:53 - Théodore Bedos: Your mum did propose me to put some of my stuff in your garage, but I don't know how I could bring them to Devon and take them back. It would be a lot of efforts
30/07/2022, 19:54 - Théodore Bedos: So I don't think that it is doable
30/07/2022, 20:04 - Gracou: Yeah it sounds cool
30/07/2022, 20:05 - Gracou: I think it isn’t very doable either for  a few reasons
30/07/2022, 20:15 - Gracou: If you compare the £200 to the petrol your dad would spend it isn’t so bad x
30/07/2022, 20:19 - Théodore Bedos: I know, I know but with my dad I would have my belongings with me in Paris. Which is needed for 4 months. This time it's 2minth so it should be ok with just a luggage.
30/07/2022, 20:31 - Gracou: You won’t need your pans and things
30/07/2022, 20:31 - Gracou: You should only need to bring your clothes and technology j think
30/07/2022, 20:34 - Théodore Bedos: I know that I don't need my pans babe. But for example I would like my basketball shoes, my sports equipments, more shoes than just 1 pair, etc... Which is why my dad comes when I go to France for 4 months normally. But it should be fine with just a small luggage for 2 months
30/07/2022, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
30/07/2022, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: You are stunning babe
30/07/2022, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: I can't wait to see you
30/07/2022, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
30/07/2022, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: Wow 😍
30/07/2022, 21:55 - Gracou: One sec baby I will answer ur message in a min I just had another small idea
30/07/2022, 21:55 - Gracou: Just that your idea would would work for housemates as well for house expenses xx
30/07/2022, 21:57 - Théodore Bedos: We already thought about it, babe. But we have many reasons to préfère to start with a niche such as couples
30/07/2022, 21:59 - Gracou: Yes totally I I agree just had the idea
30/07/2022, 22:04 - Théodore Bedos: It is part of the strategy to expand to roommates and more by developing a more complex payment processing system in partnership with mastercard once we have proven the interest for our products with couples first
30/07/2022, 23:23 - Gracou: This is what I thought as well
30/07/2022, 23:28 - Théodore Bedos: Don't take it bad but I think it's quiet rude that you completely ignored the page of compliment that I did to you
30/07/2022, 23:43 - Théodore Bedos: Ok I am going to bed , goodnight
30/07/2022, 23:44 - Gracou: I literally said I would answer later
30/07/2022, 23:45 - Gracou: I have been moving house all day and Bampy has been admitted to hospital today because he can’t breathe properly and I had to go to his house to get overnight stuff for him and take him to the hospital
30/07/2022, 23:46 - Gracou: So actually when I got home all I wanted to do was finish watching my dads programme set next to him on the Aidan
30/07/2022, 23:46 - Gracou: Sofa
30/07/2022, 23:46 - Gracou: And the first thing I thought to do wasn’t to go on my phone
30/07/2022, 23:48 - Gracou: Goodnight
30/07/2022, 23:48 - Gracou: Take the bag to the hospital*
31/07/2022, 08:15 - Théodore Bedos: How is doing Roger since he is at the hospital?
31/07/2022, 08:16 - Théodore Bedos: Did he got COVID?
31/07/2022, 08:30 - Théodore Bedos: Listen babe, I know that you have been moving house and that you said that you'll answer in a minute, so that's why I waited. And after more than 2h I thought that the "I'll answer in a minute" message was about something else.

 But that's no big deal, it's just adding to the fact that this week, I have been calling you Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, sometimes multiple times per evening. You never answered, which it's fine, you were probably busy. But I wish you would have called me back at least once😢.
31/07/2022, 08:32 - Théodore Bedos: I don't want to make you feel like I am reproaching you things. I just wanted to let you know for the future that it made me feel not so good.
31/07/2022, 08:33 - Théodore Bedos: And I am sorry to have lost patience the same day that Roger went to the hospital. It was really bad timing. Sorry
31/07/2022, 11:26 - Gracou: Yes he has had covid for the last few weeks
31/07/2022, 11:26 - Gracou: Luckily he is doing better in the hospital this morning
31/07/2022, 11:27 - Gracou: Ive been very extremely busy this week and I’m sorry I didn’t have time to call you back
31/07/2022, 11:27 - Gracou: Please trust that if I do that it’s just because I’m really busy
31/07/2022, 11:28 - Théodore Bedos: Great
31/07/2022, 11:28 - Théodore Bedos: Did he had COVID before?
31/07/2022, 11:29 - Gracou: No I think this is the first time
31/07/2022, 11:29 - Théodore Bedos: Both my parents had it 3weeks ago but it was way better than the first time
31/07/2022, 11:30 - Théodore Bedos: I trust you babe. I just wanted to let you know how I felt. Again I am sorry for loosing patience I should have communicated better before
31/07/2022, 11:31 - Théodore Bedos: It must be so tiring to have it for weeks
31/07/2022, 11:54 - Gracou: I am
Sorry I upset you
31/07/2022, 11:54 - Gracou: Yes exactly
31/07/2022, 11:54 - Gracou: Babe I was thinking of getting another sofa for our living room
31/07/2022, 11:55 - Gracou: It will be better for if we have people over, and if we wanted one to lie out on and be a bit more comfortable
31/07/2022, 11:55 - Gracou: What do you think?
31/07/2022, 12:01 - Théodore Bedos: Instead of the other one or on as well as the other one?
31/07/2022, 12:04 - Théodore Bedos: This was an error
31/07/2022, 12:05 - Gracou: Ah okay
31/07/2022, 12:05 - Théodore Bedos: I am at the gym
31/07/2022, 12:05 - Gracou: As well as the other one
31/07/2022, 12:06 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know, I think it's early to decide. Let's wait to see how it looks like when we add a desk to this room first.
31/07/2022, 12:06 - Gracou: Okay
31/07/2022, 12:06 - Gracou: I do think it would be nice :)
31/07/2022, 12:07 - Théodore Bedos: Remember that when we tried to see what it would look like with a corner for a desk, a corner for dinning and a corner for the TV and sofa it was already very tight in space if not too tight
31/07/2022, 12:07 - Gracou: Okay we can see at the time
31/07/2022, 12:09 - Gracou: When I think about it also, I think it could be good to have quite a long desk that we both could sit at if we wanted to
31/07/2022, 12:15 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know if that's doable, but that seems nice too
31/07/2022, 12:16 - Théodore Bedos: There is a guy who is looking at me a bit too intensively at the gym. I don't feel comfortable
31/07/2022, 12:16 - Théodore Bedos: I feel bad for the girls that have to feel like this often
31/07/2022, 12:18 - Gracou: That is how I feel in the gym a lot
31/07/2022, 12:26 - Théodore Bedos: Come with I will protect you
31/07/2022, 12:26 - Théodore Bedos: I will duel every guy who makes you feel uncomfortable
31/07/2022, 12:27 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

31/07/2022, 15:22 - Théodore Bedos: The course is 3h every morning from Monday to Friday. A workshop is an extra 2h in the afternoon. And it cost something extra.You don't have to take them if 3h per day is fine for you
31/07/2022, 15:24 - Théodore Bedos: It's focus on a specific skills, so it's different than the morning classes

31/07/2022, 15:54 - Théodore Bedos: What does it says?
31/07/2022, 15:55 - Gracou: I did it very quickly and didn’t take as much time as I should have done
31/07/2022, 15:55 - Gracou: But it says I’m A2
31/07/2022, 15:55 - Théodore Bedos: Do you think you should be B1?
31/07/2022, 15:56 - Gracou: I would rather start in A2 and then if they think I’m good enough move me
Up
31/07/2022, 15:56 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, let's go A2 then
31/07/2022, 15:56 - Gracou: That test was a lot to do with spelling and grammar which I’m not very good at so I don’t think I would be that good at a harder level
31/07/2022, 15:57 - Théodore Bedos: I am sure they will 1dapt if you are better than A2
31/07/2022, 15:57 - Théodore Bedos: Let me know when it is booked. It's been on my mind all week. I just want it to be secured

03/08/2022, 23:48 - Gracou: Also
03/08/2022, 23:49 - Gracou: Im not sure how many books to bring on holiday
04/08/2022, 09:45 - Théodore Bedos: Depend on the size but I would say 2
04/08/2022, 09:45 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe 3
04/08/2022, 09:46 - Théodore Bedos: I would say 2 and if you finish them we will order one in English for you on Amazon
04/08/2022, 10:38 - Gracou: I think I will need more
04/08/2022, 10:38 - Gracou: Im thailand I Will probably read a lot
04/08/2022, 10:41 - Théodore Bedos: I think 2 books for 3 weeks is fine if they are not small
04/08/2022, 10:45 - Gracou: I currently am planning on bringing 8 🙈 cut down from 10
04/08/2022, 10:45 - Gracou: But the plan was that would last the whole 6 weeks
04/08/2022, 10:52 - Théodore Bedos: Babe come on!!!! That is non sense
04/08/2022, 10:52 - Gracou: Don’t tell me off it’s my decision how many books I take!
04/08/2022, 10:52 - Théodore Bedos: Wow calm down
04/08/2022, 10:53 - Théodore Bedos: You agreed to bring a lighter luggage and now you are talking on bringing 10 books
04/08/2022, 10:53 - Théodore Bedos: That is silly
04/08/2022, 10:53 - Gracou: I agreed to bring less clothes
04/08/2022, 10:54 - Gracou: Anyway 8 books is probably too heavy I suppose for the weight limit
04/08/2022, 10:56 - Théodore Bedos: 😩😩
04/08/2022, 10:56 - Théodore Bedos: Off course it's too heavy
04/08/2022, 10:57 - Théodore Bedos: I told you, we usually brings a lot of things back from Thailand, you need to keep space in your luggage
04/08/2022, 10:58 - Théodore Bedos: And we will have to do a very long trip to get their. Their will be metro in Paris, multiple flights, taxies and boats. You don't want to be carrying 20kg if luggage.
04/08/2022, 11:00 - Théodore Bedos: And no I am sorry but as long as you gonna make me carry your luggage when it's too heavy, I will have a word to say in this.
04/08/2022, 11:02 - Gracou: This is fair enough but I think your tone was a bit off in the first message
04/08/2022, 11:04 - Théodore Bedos: 10 books babe! How do you want me to react, that is non sense.
04/08/2022, 11:04 - Gracou: No I said 8 books
04/08/2022, 11:04 - Gracou: I cut down from 10 I had originally
04/08/2022, 11:04 - Gracou: And then I agreed that 8 would still be too heavy
04/08/2022, 11:05 - Théodore Bedos: But even 8 babe!
04/08/2022, 11:05 - Gracou: I said it would still be too heavy so I’m clearly not bringing 8!
04/08/2022, 11:05 - Théodore Bedos: It seems like you forgot every time how much of a pain it is to carry your luggage
04/08/2022, 11:06 - Théodore Bedos: At skiing, I carried it and it was like if you had stones in it
04/08/2022, 11:06 - Théodore Bedos: After Croatia, I carried it again and it was the same
04/08/2022, 11:06 - Gracou: Yes Croatia was too heavy
04/08/2022, 11:08 - Théodore Bedos: I don't think we even read one book last summer in France. In 5 weeks.
04/08/2022, 11:08 - Gracou: Well I’m general I read more now
04/08/2022, 11:08 - Gracou: And on the beach it is different
04/08/2022, 11:21 - Théodore Bedos: How many pages a day do you think you would read?
04/08/2022, 11:22 - Théodore Bedos: In average, not how many you can read in day

04/08/2022, 11:25 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah but this time you'll have an hyperactive boyfriend to do a lot of activities
04/08/2022, 11:25 - Théodore Bedos: Take 4 then, and if you need more we will order more in France
04/08/2022, 11:26 - Gracou: I already bought a few…

04/08/2022, 15:38 - Théodore Bedos: I can tell you in advance that my mom or my dad will make me a remark about it.
04/08/2022, 15:38 - Théodore Bedos: Like you should stop now you are too big
04/08/2022, 15:42 - Gracou: No baby you need to be very sexy to have a bikini body in Thailand

04/08/2022, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: I know summer body
04/08/2022, 17:20 - Théodore Bedos: I squatted 6 reps at 2.5 Graces at the gym
04/08/2022, 17:20 - Théodore Bedos: I am pretty happy about it
04/08/2022, 17:21 - Théodore Bedos: Since my operation I haven't been able to do that without injuring myself
04/08/2022, 17:21 - Théodore Bedos: Objectif 3 graces
04/08/2022, 17:53 - Gracou: It’s a funny way of saying summer body
04/08/2022, 17:53 - Gracou: 🤦🏽‍♀️
05/08/2022, 00:48 - Gracou: Good night baby
05/08/2022, 09:27 - Théodore Bedos: Good morning gorgeous
05/08/2022, 09:27 - Théodore Bedos: Hope your night wasn't too scary
05/08/2022, 11:06 - Gracou: I had a scary nightmare!
05/08/2022, 11:32 - Théodore Bedos: Oh no! What was it?
05/08/2022, 11:33 - Théodore Bedos: Also I have receive an email saying that there was delays for security checks at the airport this weekend. So they say that we should arrive 2.5 hours before our flight
05/08/2022, 11:34 - Gracou: Someone had the power to suddenly make everyone try to kill a person
05/08/2022, 11:34 - Gracou: And he wanted to kill me
05/08/2022, 11:34 - Gracou: They say this everytime darling
05/08/2022, 11:34 - Gracou: But yes I like being there early
05/08/2022, 11:35 - Théodore Bedos: Do you think it's the first time I take a plane????
05/08/2022, 11:35 - Théodore Bedos: I know how to make the difference between a normal recommendation email and a proper warning email.
05/08/2022, 11:36 - Gracou: They have sent that email every time I have boarded a plane recently
05/08/2022, 11:36 - Gracou: Which is a lot of planes
05/08/2022, 11:36 - Gracou: So defensive for no reason
05/08/2022, 11:40 - Théodore Bedos: Because that was patronising
I have been to Bristol airport multiple times a year since five year and they never told me that
05/08/2022, 11:41 - Théodore Bedos: Who wanted to kill you?
05/08/2022, 12:26 - Gracou: It wasn’t I was just saying they have told me that every time
05/08/2022, 12:26 - Gracou: That’s not patronising
05/08/2022, 12:26 - Gracou: And then I even said I want to be there early too
05/08/2022, 12:27 - Gracou: That’s a big overreaction
05/08/2022, 12:27 - Gracou: Ed westwick
05/08/2022, 12:27 - Gracou: Have a nice last day
05/08/2022, 13:28 - Théodore Bedos: I did not even know who he was until I googled him
05/08/2022, 13:28 - Théodore Bedos: Why did he wanted to kill you?
05/08/2022, 13:28 - Gracou: I’m glad you googled him
05/08/2022, 13:28 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you
05/08/2022, 13:29 - Gracou: Erm I think I knew about his special ability bc he tried to kill me before but I escaped
05/08/2022, 13:29 - Gracou: So he came back to try to kill me again
05/08/2022, 13:43 - Théodore Bedos: And why did he wanted to kill you the first time?
05/08/2022, 15:21 - Gracou: I can’t remember
05/08/2022, 16:05 - Théodore Bedos: You need to remember for apologizing the next time he comes back
05/08/2022, 16:39 - Gracou: No he was being completely unreasonable and should appologise to me
05/08/2022, 17:29 - Théodore Bedos: You are right
05/08/2022, 17:29 - Théodore Bedos: Were was I?
05/08/2022, 17:39 - Gracou: It’s better that you weren’t there to be honest, Ed killed darcy
05/08/2022, 17:41 - Théodore Bedos: Oh noooo
05/08/2022, 17:41 - Théodore Bedos: But I would have saved you
05/08/2022, 17:54 - Gracou: Nooo this dude would have gotten you too I was the only one skilled enough to evade him
05/08/2022, 21:32 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks for keeping me away from him babe. But you know I would risk my life for you
05/08/2022, 21:32 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
05/08/2022, 21:32 - Théodore Bedos: Finally got the peanut butter burger
05/08/2022, 21:33 - Théodore Bedos: I thought of getting it every day since I live here
05/08/2022, 21:33 - Théodore Bedos: It would have finally been for the last day of work
05/08/2022, 21:38 - Gracou: You are welcome
05/08/2022, 21:38 - Gracou: That’s great
06/08/2022, 09:54 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

06/08/2022, 15:46 - Gracou: Can you call me at 7 and make sure I’m awake
06/08/2022, 15:46 - Gracou: I still need to pack

06/08/2022, 16:18 - Théodore Bedos: I got 3 more to do!!!!
06/08/2022, 17:01 - Gracou: Oh no baby
06/08/2022, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
06/08/2022, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: Done
06/08/2022, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: Omg you can't imagine how tough it was
07/08/2022, 10:05 - Théodore Bedos: If you are not already gone, please take some sport clothes with you so that we can maybe do a bit of sport together in Thailand
07/08/2022, 10:53 - Gracou: Have you got your boarding pass
07/08/2022, 10:53 - Gracou: I did
07/08/2022, 10:54 - Gracou: Nice
07/08/2022, 10:57 - Théodore Bedos: I do yes
07/08/2022, 11:23 - Gracou: What time will you be there
07/08/2022, 11:23 - Gracou: It won’t let me generate my boarding pass :(
07/08/2022, 11:23 - Théodore Bedos: 13h45 I think
07/08/2022, 11:24 - Gracou: That’s a bit late
07/08/2022, 11:24 - Théodore Bedos: It didn't let me get it too through the email link. But if you go directly on the website and login with your reservation details, you will have the option
07/08/2022, 11:24 - Théodore Bedos: The luggage deposit opens at 2
07/08/2022, 11:24 - Gracou: Ah thanks babe I will try that
07/08/2022, 11:25 - Gracou: Really?!
07/08/2022, 11:25 - Gracou: I think you will still be able to do self serve
07/08/2022, 11:26 - Théodore Bedos: That's what it says on the boarding pass
07/08/2022, 11:34 - Gracou: Yeah it won’t let me check in which is very annoying
07/08/2022, 11:44 - Théodore Bedos: On the website?

07/08/2022, 13:14 - Gracou: I went there darlineg
07/08/2022, 13:15 - Gracou: I just arrived at the airport
07/08/2022, 13:15 - Théodore Bedos: Wow that's early
07/08/2022, 13:15 - Gracou: There could have been traffic
07/08/2022, 13:15 - Théodore Bedos: True
07/08/2022, 13:15 - Gracou: And it’s 3 hours before the flight which is when I like to arrive
07/08/2022, 13:20 - Théodore Bedos: I thought I was finally getting away from people that arrives way too early at airports such as my parents. Don't tell me that I just jumped back into the arm of someone else like that!!
07/08/2022, 13:30 - Gracou: I thought you knew this about me
07/08/2022, 13:37 - Théodore Bedos: I thought it was just because your parents were forcing you to
07/08/2022, 13:51 - Théodore Bedos: The bus is taking a bit long, I'll be there at 2
07/08/2022, 13:51 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe wait for me to register your luggage, I might have some stuff to put in your luggage
07/08/2022, 13:58 - Théodore Bedos: Actually I'll probably be there at 14:30. I have never seen the bus stopping that much
07/08/2022, 13:59 - Gracou: I already checked my bag
07/08/2022, 13:59 - Gracou: It was a bit heavy so I’m not sure I could take your things
07/08/2022, 13:59 - Gracou: Yes i was on it last time it’s Awful
07/08/2022, 13:59 - Théodore Bedos: Every time I took it was so fast, less than 1h
07/08/2022, 14:00 - Théodore Bedos: Don't know why it is taking ages
07/08/2022, 14:00 - Gracou: No it’s so
Miserable
07/08/2022, 14:00 - Théodore Bedos: Are the security checks fast or Kong queues like in the email?
07/08/2022, 14:01 - Théodore Bedos: Will told me that when he went in may, there was queues up to out of the airport
07/08/2022, 14:01 - Gracou: Fast
07/08/2022, 14:01 - Gracou: Like I said they send the email a lot
07/08/2022, 14:01 - Gracou: But it may get busier closer to the time 🤷‍♀️
07/08/2022, 14:03 - Théodore Bedos: Cool I should be fine then
07/08/2022, 14:07 - Gracou: Would you like me to wait for you or can I go in?
07/08/2022, 14:07 - Gracou: Security is quiet at the moment
07/08/2022, 14:11 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué

07/08/2022, 16:00 - Gracou: The seat next to me is empty if you want to come during the flight
07/08/2022, 16:00 - Gracou: Once the seat belt signs go off
07/08/2022, 16:00 - Théodore Bedos: Good to know
08/08/2022, 13:21 - Théodore Bedos: I hope you are having a good time
08/08/2022, 13:22 - Théodore Bedos: I asked them to put you in the group above (B1) that is in the morning if they think you are good enough 😉
08/08/2022, 13:56 - Gracou: They won’t think I’m good enough I’m the worst in this class all ready 😂

23/09/2022, 22:59 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
23/09/2022, 22:59 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
23/09/2022, 22:59 - Théodore Bedos: Look at my room🥲
23/09/2022, 23:47 - Théodore Bedos: We emptied everything
23/09/2022, 23:56 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my love
23/09/2022, 23:59 - Gracou: Why is it so empty?!
23/09/2022, 23:59 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/09/2022, 08:05 - Théodore Bedos: Because they are repainting it before selling the appartement
24/09/2022, 09:19 - Théodore Bedos: I just realised that the storage box place is closed on Sunday. So when you will come tomorrow we won't be able to go to the storage place with your car. Are you gonna keep the car ?
24/09/2022, 09:32 - Théodore Bedos: So cute
24/09/2022, 09:33 - Théodore Bedos: But I am glad you worked on that smile
24/09/2022, 10:30 - Gracou: No they aren’t letting me bring my car x
24/09/2022, 10:32 - Théodore Bedos: Oh that's annoying, Tom told me we could maybe have a private parking place at the appartement
24/09/2022, 10:33 - Théodore Bedos: And that means that I won't be able to get my stuff back unless I pay 300pounds of ubers
24/09/2022, 10:33 - Gracou: Why didn’t you tell me about the private parking place?
24/09/2022, 10:34 - Théodore Bedos: Because I asked yesterday and answered me this morning
24/09/2022, 10:34 - Gracou: Is this a maybe or a definitely?
24/09/2022, 10:34 - Théodore Bedos: It's a maybe, he is asking to be sure
24/09/2022, 10:34 - Gracou: Ok
24/09/2022, 10:34 - Gracou: Well my parents said no to me bringing the car
24/09/2022, 10:35 - Gracou: If we get a parking space I may be able to convince them a little
24/09/2022, 10:42 - Théodore Bedos: Can you try to insist please because if you don't have it I really don't know how am I going to get my stuffs.
24/09/2022, 10:43 - Gracou: They are probably going to say no
24/09/2022, 10:43 - Gracou: Especially since I have no where to put it if I don’t have that space
24/09/2022, 10:47 - Théodore Bedos: Tom answered me that we have as much right as anyone else to park a car in the parking. And he told me that he went to check and saw a place this morning
24/09/2022, 10:48 - Théodore Bedos: He said that you can bring it if you want
24/09/2022, 10:48 - Théodore Bedos: If you can't bring the car can you envisage coming today?
24/09/2022, 10:50 - Gracou: Wait so do you have to pay for the parking?
24/09/2022, 10:51 - Gracou: I can’t come today
24/09/2022, 10:51 - Gracou: It’s too last minute I have to do tax stuff with my dad and I have dinner with my whole family tonight and I haven’t finished packing
24/09/2022, 10:55 - Théodore Bedos: No you don't, why do you say that?
24/09/2022, 10:56 - Théodore Bedos: I said that you have as much right as anyone else in the building to park your cart in the court
24/09/2022, 10:56 - Théodore Bedos: Your car*
24/09/2022, 11:01 - Gracou: Is the parking on the street?
24/09/2022, 11:05 - Théodore Bedos: No it is in the coutyard
24/09/2022, 11:05 - Théodore Bedos: Behind the entrance
24/09/2022, 11:06 - Gracou: Do you have a picture?
24/09/2022, 11:06 - Théodore Bedos: You know can see it from the bathroom
24/09/2022, 11:06 - Gracou: Ah the one behind okay
24/09/2022, 11:06 - Gracou: That’s good
24/09/2022, 11:06 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
24/09/2022, 11:06 - Théodore Bedos: I just have this
24/09/2022, 11:06 - Gracou: That’s like a proper place it will be easier to convince them
24/09/2022, 11:07 - Gracou: But I will have to drive up seperately to my mum bc my car isn’t big enough to take all my stuff
24/09/2022, 11:07 - Gracou: When my dad gets home I will talk to him about it
24/09/2022, 11:08 - Théodore Bedos: Ok thank you babe

24/09/2022, 12:23 - Gracou: Thanks babe
24/09/2022, 12:53 - Gracou: As I expected all that happened was I ended up in a screaming match with my dad
24/09/2022, 12:53 - Gracou: The answer is no
24/09/2022, 13:33 - Théodore Bedos: I feel bad for you that you had to go in such an argument
24/09/2022, 13:33 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks for trying
24/09/2022, 13:33 - Théodore Bedos: Just out of curiosity what is the reason that your father gave you

24/09/2022, 14:47 - Théodore Bedos: Wow
24/09/2022, 14:47 - Théodore Bedos: Why are you so cold like that
24/09/2022, 14:48 - Gracou: Bc I don’t want to get into a discussion about the reasoning
24/09/2022, 14:49 - Théodore Bedos: I was just asking why was he against. I know the debate is over. I am just curious babe
24/09/2022, 14:49 - Théodore Bedos: I am not asking you to keep debating
24/09/2022, 14:50 - Gracou: Yes I will tell you the answer and then you will have a debate with me about it
24/09/2022, 14:50 - Gracou: Which is why I don’t want to talk about it
24/09/2022, 14:53 - Théodore Bedos: I just told you that I won't
24/09/2022, 14:54 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/09/2022, 14:57 - Gracou: I’m on my period and I’m feeling a bit emotional
24/09/2022, 14:57 - Gracou: I’m a bit annoyed at you for asking me to insist with them when you know I’ve had this argument with them so many times
24/09/2022, 14:58 - Gracou: It was a bit thoughtless
24/09/2022, 15:28 - Théodore Bedos: Alright thank you for the explanation
24/09/2022, 15:37 - Théodore Bedos: I understand why it can upset you, it's just that now I don't have any solution to get my stuffs back unless paying tones of ubers
24/09/2022, 15:38 - Gracou: But you told me so last minute that there is not much I can do to help this
24/09/2022, 15:39 - Gracou: But I am still trying
24/09/2022, 15:40 - Théodore Bedos: I know baby I am not blaming you at all, I know it's not your decision to not be bringing the car and it's me who forgot that the storage was closed on Sunday
24/09/2022, 15:40 - Gracou: Okay thanks
24/09/2022, 15:41 - Gracou: I’m sorry you’re stressed too

02/12/2022, 09:36 - Théodore Bedos: The guy who did it need a raise
02/12/2022, 09:37 - Théodore Bedos: The music, the tone of the voice over, the twist at the end!!! Genius
02/12/2022, 09:37 - Gracou: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMF4VPJ7J/
02/12/2022, 09:38 - Gracou: This is clever
02/12/2022, 09:39 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah
02/12/2022, 09:40 - Théodore Bedos: But I would have skipped the add after 5 second
02/12/2022, 09:40 - Théodore Bedos: I watched the grans one till the end because I wanted to see a gran like Mana on this epic music
02/12/2022, 09:40 - Théodore Bedos: And when I saw the twist I was really wowed
02/12/2022, 14:24 - Gracou: So negative
02/12/2022, 15:19 - Gracou: Remind me who should be the top 5
02/12/2022, 15:27 - Théodore Bedos: I haven't think of the order so I am just giving you a shuffled top 5. But there should be Nadal, Tom Brady, Usain Bolt, Messi, and between LeBron James and Michael Phelps. That is a mix between dominancy and aura.
02/12/2022, 15:28 - Théodore Bedos: If it's just about the dominancy over a sport. It should be Sebastian Loeb, Usain Bolt, Teddy Riner, Michael Phelps, Nikola Karabatic
02/12/2022, 15:30 - Gracou: A french handball player?
02/12/2022, 15:30 - Gracou: Interesting
02/12/2022, 15:30 - Gracou: Nadal is apparently not the best tennis player of all time
02/12/2022, 15:30 - Théodore Bedos: He is
02/12/2022, 15:31 - Théodore Bedos: He has the most gran Schleme
02/12/2022, 15:31 - Théodore Bedos: And he is not done playing
02/12/2022, 15:34 - Théodore Bedos: Nikola Karabatic, 3 olympic gold medal and potentially a 4th one coming. 4 world championship, 2 European championship. He won in a raw, the European championship, the world championship and the Olympics. That's close to impossible
03/12/2022, 23:20 - Théodore Bedos: Did you arrive well?
03/12/2022, 23:37 - Gracou: Yes xx
05/12/2022, 16:34 - Gracou: hey announced 7 mins before my lecture started that it was cancelled

22/12/2022, 20:10 - Théodore Bedos: You remember the band videoclub that you have shown to me?
22/12/2022, 21:33 - Théodore Bedos: Amour plastique
22/12/2022, 21:33 - Gracou: Yes
22/12/2022, 21:34 - Théodore Bedos: She is from my family
22/12/2022, 21:34 - Gracou: Whhhaaaaaaaat
22/12/2022, 21:34 - Gracou: What is it with your family and celebrities
22/12/2022, 21:34 - Théodore Bedos: She is the niece of my uncle
22/12/2022, 21:34 - Gracou: Crazy
22/12/2022, 21:34 - Théodore Bedos: But not the same blood
22/12/2022, 21:35 - Gracou: Which uncle
22/12/2022, 21:35 - Théodore Bedos: It is by alliance
22/12/2022, 21:35 - Gracou: So cool
22/12/2022, 21:36 - Théodore Bedos: So you remember my grand ant that we saw just before we left Bernieres? She has daughter (my ant) who is married to a man whose sister is the mother of the singer
22/12/2022, 21:36 - Gracou: Wow so close
22/12/2022, 21:37 - Théodore Bedos: No not so close
22/12/2022, 21:37 - Gracou: I know 😂
22/12/2022, 21:37 - Théodore Bedos: But still I thought you would find it funny
22/12/2022, 21:47 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
22/12/2022, 21:48 - Théodore Bedos: I got myself a little berserk and the last one of Kaiju n°8 as a reward for finishing my CW
22/12/2022, 21:48 - Théodore Bedos: Kaiju n°8 is just so good
22/12/2022, 21:51 - Gracou: Ooo nice reward
22/12/2022, 21:52 - Gracou: By the way babe my parents aren’t sure what to get you x could u send me your list?
22/12/2022, 21:58 - Théodore Bedos: What about they don't make me a gift. I feel a bit uncomfortable with that. It's not going very well with my parents business at the moment and I don't feel like asking them to make you gift. Especially as they are not doing it for my sister's boyfriend.
22/12/2022, 21:59 - Gracou: Babe I really don’t need a gift from your parents x
22/12/2022, 21:59 - Gracou: But my parents just wanted to get you a small one
22/12/2022, 21:59 - Gracou: The gift from your parents would be the beautiful holiday they gave me anyway
22/12/2022, 22:00 - Théodore Bedos: Then that would make me feel even more uncomfortable if they offer me something but mine don't.
22/12/2022, 22:00 - Gracou: But they did they took me on holiday x
22/12/2022, 22:00 - Théodore Bedos: This was for your birthday
22/12/2022, 22:00 - Gracou: Yes but it was a huuuuuge gift
22/12/2022, 22:01 - Théodore Bedos: Your parent said that skiing was my Christmas present so it's too the same
22/12/2022, 22:01 - Gracou: Well yes but skiing was for much less time
22/12/2022, 22:03 - Théodore Bedos: But even that I find it a bit wierd, like, I said that it would  be your birthday present because that is sort of what your parent did for my Christmas so I thought that was a good match. But honestly my parent would have taken you on holiday with us regardless if it was a birthday present or not that time
22/12/2022, 22:04 - Gracou: Okay no problem babe they don’t need to get you anything
22/12/2022, 22:04 - Théodore Bedos: Like we don't go on holiday like that every year so I would find it uncomfortable if every time one of us is invited to Holliday the other have to match with another holiday or offer something to match
22/12/2022, 22:05 - Gracou: Well no clearly not babe

25/12/2022, 11:59 - Théodore Bedos: I am not saying she should wear a Christmas but that's quiet the opposite of the Christmas spirit
25/12/2022, 15:35 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
25/12/2022, 15:35 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
25/12/2022, 19:28 - Gracou: Miss you!
25/12/2022, 19:29 - Gracou: I thought this was funny
25/12/2022, 19:38 - Théodore Bedos: I miss you too
25/12/2022, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: It's really something that I am confused about every time
25/12/2022, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: How were you dressed today?
25/12/2022, 20:32 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
25/12/2022, 20:32 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
25/12/2022, 20:33 - Gracou: Well you can wear what u want for xmas really
25/12/2022, 20:33 - Gracou: U just have to get dressed up a little
25/12/2022, 23:04 - Gracou: What were the other board games you liked babe?
26/12/2022, 11:22 - Théodore Bedos: Not soo many really I think it's a wonderfull world was the last one on our list.
26/12/2022, 11:24 - Théodore Bedos: There was just star realms frontier, the extension for playing multiplayer that I think would be nice to have to play with Disha and Joe.
26/12/2022, 12:17 - Théodore Bedos: Or some unmatched extension like Bruce Lee,  robin hood or Jurassic park. But you don't like to play it much so not sure.
26/12/2022, 12:18 - Théodore Bedos: I think we got a lot of games now, I would probably wait until the next summer to maybe get another one.
26/12/2022, 12:23 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you ask by the way?
26/12/2022, 12:59 - Gracou: I just couldn’t remember if we wanted any more :)
26/12/2022, 12:59 - Gracou: Yeah I think so too
26/12/2022, 12:59 - Gracou: That could be a good idea
26/12/2022, 13:00 - Gracou: I had a look into it and found that I think we can already play multiplayer
26/12/2022, 13:54 - Gracou: When are flying back here?
26/12/2022, 14:31 - Théodore Bedos: The 29th at 10:50 am
26/12/2022, 14:55 - Théodore Bedos: You should watch Glass Onion with your Dad on netflix, it's really good
26/12/2022, 15:03 - Gracou: So early 😂
26/12/2022, 15:03 - Gracou: Thank you for the recommendation, my dad says well watch it this evening
26/12/2022, 15:07 - Théodore Bedos: I know sorry, I thought it was PM but is AM
26/12/2022, 15:42 - Gracou: Well PM might actually have been worse :)
26/12/2022, 15:42 - Gracou: But then I guess we could have stayed the night in bath
26/12/2022, 18:26 - Théodore Bedos: My mom wants to know if you have seen "love actually"?
26/12/2022, 18:27 - Théodore Bedos: And "4 wedding and a funeral"?
26/12/2022, 18:33 - Gracou: Yes
26/12/2022, 18:33 - Gracou: I can’t remember
26/12/2022, 18:34 - Gracou: Why does she ask
26/12/2022, 18:41 - Théodore Bedos: And she wants to know if you liked it?
26/12/2022, 18:42 - Théodore Bedos: Because she thinks it's a Christmas classic and it's English so she was wondering if it was famous in England or in your family
26/12/2022, 19:05 - Gracou: It’s not particularly big in my family
26/12/2022, 19:05 - Gracou: Live actually is a uk film so quite big in the uk
26/12/2022, 21:52 - Théodore Bedos: What did you think of the Glass Onion?
26/12/2022, 21:53 - Théodore Bedos: We just watch the 1st one with my dad and we really liked it
26/12/2022, 22:14 - Théodore Bedos: It is called knives out
27/12/2022, 00:09 - Gracou: We didn’t watch it in the end :/

27/12/2022, 10:19 - Théodore Bedos: That's funny
27/12/2022, 10:20 - Théodore Bedos: My dad fell asleep every 5min when we watched a movie 2 days ago. And every time I woke him up he pretended not to be asleep. So I turned off the TV and all the lights and left, he realizes only 30 min after
27/12/2022, 11:39 - Gracou: Tehe
27/12/2022, 11:39 - Gracou: Very funny
27/12/2022, 22:33 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight darling 😘

29/12/2022, 19:47 - Gracou: Because I would like to see you sooner!
29/12/2022, 20:29 - Théodore Bedos: Oh ok, that's nice then. I thought you went at the train station at the wrong time.

06/01/2023, 17:17 - Gracou: Cool!
06/01/2023, 17:17 - Théodore Bedos: The guy is a bit wierd so you have to make abstraction of him. But the fit seems amazing on the trouser
06/01/2023, 17:17 - Gracou: Nice side part
06/01/2023, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: This brand is amazing I just discovered it. They do only 4 trouser, they are all high waisted, with pince on the side and wide legs. It might be the absolut perfect fit for my small waist big booty big thigh morphology.
06/01/2023, 17:54 - Gracou: How did you discover it?
06/01/2023, 17:54 - Gracou: Small waist big booty big thigh morphology 😂

06/01/2023, 19:12 - Théodore Bedos: But you seemed to be wanting a diamond so much
06/01/2023, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: I am personally more used to just gold, like the one I offered you at valentine's day last year. Because that's what my mom sell and wear but you seem to really want a diamond
06/01/2023, 19:36 - Gracou: Yes but I think it maybe needs to be like a smaller one set in gold to make it more low key
06/01/2023, 19:36 - Gracou: I don’t want to leave your mums one on all the time in case it breaks or the colour goes x
06/01/2023, 20:16 - Théodore Bedos: You'll show me

01/03/2023, 15:48 - Gracou: im staying at dishas house tonight btw
01/03/2023, 16:13 - Théodore Bedos: Not coming for sleeping?
01/03/2023, 16:13 - Gracou: No I will sleep over at hers since I always end up staying there so late anyway
01/03/2023, 16:14 - Gracou: We are going to the gym together in the morning
01/03/2023, 16:14 - Théodore Bedos: That's probably overestimating my arts culture

01/03/2023, 18:09 - Gracou: Are you at the gym?
01/03/2023, 18:17 - Théodore Bedos: No I am on campus
01/03/2023, 18:17 - Gracou: Oh
01/03/2023, 18:17 - Théodore Bedos: I have volleyball training from 8 to 10

01/03/2023, 18:29 - Gracou: You’re on campus very early

02/03/2023, 00:20 - Théodore Bedos: I hope I won't make bad nightmares like last night
02/03/2023, 10:20 - Théodore Bedos: I have thrown away the fajitas left. I had a bad poo this morning. I am pretty sure it was because of the chicken.
02/03/2023, 10:21 - Gracou: Oh dear I hope you’re okay
02/03/2023, 10:22 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
02/03/2023, 10:27 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, it's just one bad poo
02/03/2023, 10:28 - Théodore Bedos: Nice, I am glad Disha is able to make you use the free weights. I am too scared
02/03/2023, 10:28 - Théodore Bedos: You'll tell me if you wer ok with it and we might put some in your training
02/03/2023, 11:48 - Gracou: Why do you want to put free weights in?
02/03/2023, 12:19 - Théodore Bedos: Because it's more often free than the machine. And it makes the movement be more specific to your morphology. Unlike machines that are made to fit most people
02/03/2023, 13:02 - Théodore Bedos: I have been selected to buy tickets for the Olympic games of 2024 in France.  I can buy up to 30 tickets. I can see that there are tickets remaining for féminin golf. You should ask you're dad if he is interested. I can get tickets for him
02/03/2023, 13:03 - Théodore Bedos: There are also, basketball, volleyball, football, sailing, weightlifting, 7 rugby, handball and tracks available.

02/03/2023, 17:06 - Gracou: I just have some more work I need to finish tonight I will try to be quick

08/03/2023, 16:45 - Gracou: And do your parents want to listen to you say soppy things to your gf
08/03/2023, 16:46 - Théodore Bedos: I don't think my parents would care if I said goodbye my beautiful girlfriend that I love a lot
08/03/2023, 16:46 - Théodore Bedos: Why would they?
08/03/2023, 16:46 - Gracou: Theodore it’s hardly as if you are that affectionate when we say goodbye on the phone. Why are you getting worked up over this?
08/03/2023, 16:48 - Théodore Bedos: I was just joking, trying to make you say nice things. But now the fact that you have to try to find reasons for not saying 2 nice things to me do worked me up, yes.

08/03/2023, 22:28 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight gorgeous
08/03/2023, 22:28 - Théodore Bedos: Paris got eliminated of the champions league
08/03/2023, 22:28 - Théodore Bedos: It was a bad game
09/03/2023, 11:48 - Gracou: Oh no

09/03/2023, 13:06 - Théodore Bedos: If you are asking about the game. It's the champions league so it's across Europe. It was against Munich.

09/03/2023, 15:12 - Théodore Bedos: Champions League is actually not a league, it's like the world cup. If you win you got to quarter final, if you loose you are eliminated.
09/03/2023, 15:38 - Théodore Bedos: Cool, I just wanted to know if I had to make dinner for you or not.

10/04/2023, 10:49 - Gracou: yes probably
10/04/2023, 11:15 - Théodore Bedos: There is no seat available in the train. I have to stand, it's annoying
10/04/2023, 11:16 - Gracou: That is very annoying
10/04/2023, 11:16 - Gracou: I guess lots of people came to the south for the bank holiday
10/04/2023, 15:45 - Gracou: Home safe? X
10/04/2023, 15:55 - Théodore Bedos: Yes

10/04/2023, 19:58 - Gracou: babe i saw something online of this dude that fixed his hairline without surgery
10/04/2023, 19:58 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
10/04/2023, 19:58 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
10/04/2023, 19:58 - Gracou: see his hairline used to be really receded its very impressive

11/04/2023, 10:13 - Gracou: Which do you prefer
11/04/2023, 10:14 - Théodore Bedos: The second one
11/04/2023, 10:15 - Théodore Bedos: I know the 1st one is very very beautiful, more than the second one. The colour is gorgeous. But I don't like long hairs
11/04/2023, 11:39 - Gracou: Oh but if it’s a German shepherd u have to have the long hair
11/04/2023, 12:15 - Théodore Bedos: I prefer it the length of the second one
11/04/2023, 12:15 - Théodore Bedos: He looks more like the one in I am a legend
11/04/2023, 12:31 - Gracou: i prefer the first so majestic
11/04/2023, 12:58 - Théodore Bedos: I agree
11/04/2023, 12:58 - Théodore Bedos: The second one is just more like the one I always had in mind
11/04/2023, 15:37 - Gracou: https://www.hairclub.com/
11/04/2023, 15:38 - Gracou: he said he used this company's products
11/04/2023, 15:38 - Gracou: i see
11/04/2023, 16:39 - Théodore Bedos: It is relatively easy to apply for compensation on Ryanair website. You should do it
11/04/2023, 16:39 - Théodore Bedos: I tried to do it for the hotel but the reservation is under your name so they would not accept it
11/04/2023, 16:40 - Théodore Bedos: I filled one complain for "compensation only". Because it was delayed.
And one complain for "expense only" where I asked to be refunded for the train. 
You should do the same
11/04/2023, 16:57 - Gracou: https://help.ryanair.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360017824818-Submit-a-Claim
11/04/2023, 16:57 - Gracou: which type of one did u pick
11/04/2023, 16:57 - Gracou: bc it doesnt have a diversion option
11/04/2023, 16:58 - Théodore Bedos: Delayed
11/04/2023, 16:58 - Théodore Bedos: It does not work when you put cancelled
11/04/2023, 17:03 - Gracou: ok
11/04/2023, 17:03 - Gracou: thanks babe
11/04/2023, 17:13 - Gracou: have you received the money from your tenant?
11/04/2023, 17:18 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
11/04/2023, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: No I have been calling them all day. I managed to get someone, he is trying to solve the issue
11/04/2023, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: Strange page I had a different one
11/04/2023, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: Try through the app
11/04/2023, 17:20 - Théodore Bedos: I am sending you a link
11/04/2023, 17:22 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
11/04/2023, 17:23 - Gracou: Theo did you charge another train ticket to my account?
11/04/2023, 17:23 - Théodore Bedos: https://onlineform.ryanair.com/us/en/eu-261
11/04/2023, 17:23 - Théodore Bedos: https://help.ryanair.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new
11/04/2023, 17:23 - Gracou: Is this the one back from Devon?
11/04/2023, 17:24 - Théodore Bedos: No I did I did not, the card saved on my account is mine and I don't know the code at the back of yours
11/04/2023, 17:24 - Gracou: Okay I’m just checking
11/04/2023, 17:24 - Gracou: I’m not sure why that is trying to leave my account
11/04/2023, 17:24 - Gracou: Maybe it’s related to the bus fares thing?
11/04/2023, 17:25 - Théodore Bedos: but it is strange because it is the same price as my ticket
11/04/2023, 17:27 - Théodore Bedos: It says on the app that it was paid with your card. This is so strange I do not know the code at the back of your card and it is requiered to buy a ticket
11/04/2023, 17:27 - Gracou: Because it can be saved onto your phone
11/04/2023, 17:28 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it can be saved but normally you still have to complete the code at the back of the card
11/04/2023, 17:28 - Gracou: Not on an iPhone
11/04/2023, 17:28 - Gracou: So probably the same thing on urs
11/04/2023, 17:29 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway, I am deleting your card from my account and I am adding it to the list of what I owe you. Hopefully I will have the money by the end of today or tommorow
11/04/2023, 17:29 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
11/04/2023, 17:30 - Théodore Bedos: You see it's asking for the 3 digit secret code
11/04/2023, 17:30 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway, I have deleted it
11/04/2023, 17:30 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
11/04/2023, 17:30 - Théodore Bedos: No this is the train
11/04/2023, 17:30 - Théodore Bedos: from devon
11/04/2023, 17:31 - Gracou: I have two transactions for £27.95 from your number
11/04/2023, 17:31 - Gracou: So you used one of my cards once, and then the other another time
11/04/2023, 17:31 - Théodore Bedos: The one you sent me are both the same date
11/04/2023, 17:32 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
11/04/2023, 17:32 - Gracou: Sorry I meant to send this one
11/04/2023, 17:32 - Gracou: Is this ur flight?
11/04/2023, 17:32 - Théodore Bedos: This is the train from birmingham
11/04/2023, 17:32 - Théodore Bedos: look it says trainline
11/04/2023, 17:32 - Gracou: Right so do I claim that back or have you claimed it
11/04/2023, 17:33 - Théodore Bedos: I have already claimed it
11/04/2023, 17:33 - Théodore Bedos: don't claim it
11/04/2023, 17:33 - Gracou: If you have claimed it, please can you send me the money because I’m in my overdraft?
11/04/2023, 17:37 - Théodore Bedos: When I will have it off course
11/04/2023, 17:37 - Théodore Bedos: You know that as soon as I receive my rent the first thing I'll do is paying you back everything
11/04/2023, 17:40 - Gracou: Yes I know
11/04/2023, 21:44 - Théodore Bedos: It's not as impressive as it was this morning
11/04/2023, 21:44 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

13/04/2023, 21:31 - Gracou: Honestly my sister craves so much attention hahaha
13/04/2023, 21:32 - Gracou: Earlier today she just walked around groaning next to me being like ‘owwwwwww owwww’ and then wait a minute then go ‘owwwwww so much painnnnnnn’ over and over again
13/04/2023, 21:33 - Gracou: And now, hours later she has clearly come downstairs to get more pain killers, but she wants everyone to know so they pity her so she just left it out here like this
13/04/2023, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: Aha
13/04/2023, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: I hope she'll be even more annoying so that you'll come back to me sooner.
13/04/2023, 22:30 - Gracou: ❤️
13/04/2023, 23:34 - Théodore Bedos: They confirmed me that I will receive the money tommorow morning by the way.
13/04/2023, 23:58 - Gracou: Yayyyy!
13/04/2023, 23:58 - Gracou: No more buttery pasta for my baby!

14/04/2023, 18:02 - Théodore Bedos: That's my list of Hta I owe you
14/04/2023, 18:02 - Théodore Bedos: Can you let me know if I forgot something
14/04/2023, 18:03 - Gracou: I will have a think
14/04/2023, 18:03 - Gracou: Unrelated: I haven’t been able to claim back from Ryanair yet the site wasn’t letting me :/
14/04/2023, 18:04 - Théodore Bedos: Your dad said that he was paying for the car park and we would share the fuel, but that's not very fair that I don't pay for it so I added it to the list. Let me know what you think
14/04/2023, 18:05 - Théodore Bedos: You'll do it with me when you come back
14/04/2023, 21:24 - Théodore Bedos: Ryan air has refunded me the train
14/04/2023, 21:32 - Gracou: Thank you x
14/04/2023, 21:32 - Gracou: Let’s sort when we are together
14/04/2023, 21:51 - Gracou: Are u sure the book become 6?
14/04/2023, 21:52 - Théodore Bedos: The book was 10,99£ and then it was half priced.
14/04/2023, 23:17 - Théodore Bedos: I am 'ot feeling good, I feel quiet depressed
15/04/2023, 00:27 - Gracou: Why are you feeling quite depressed?
15/04/2023, 10:32 - Théodore Bedos: It's a mix between the job thing, my final year project and TBRe shits happening, I feel like I am failing everything. I am struggling to wake up. I just stay in bed one hour after my alarm ring because I don't want to start the day.
15/04/2023, 10:54 - Gracou: 🥹🥹https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGJa7mSdY/
15/04/2023, 11:02 - Gracou: Im coming home soon
15/04/2023, 11:02 - Gracou: The only way to make it better is to sit down and come up with a plan of which tasks you need to prioritise and force you to have a big day where you absolutely have to have all the tasks done x
15/04/2023, 11:36 - Théodore Bedos: I'm trying
15/04/2023, 11:36 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks
15/04/2023, 11:37 - Théodore Bedos: Please don't forget my mouse
15/04/2023, 11:37 - Théodore Bedos: Put it in your luggage if you've not done it yet, please
15/04/2023, 18:11 - Gracou: Feeling okay today?
15/04/2023, 18:51 - Théodore Bedos: A bit better because I spent a lot less time doing nothing and working hard. But still not great because despite all the work I did I don't feel like I have solved the problem I am working on
15/04/2023, 20:21 - Théodore Bedos: Not saying this to make you come faster, but I have seen that there are burgers on the menu of the 16th Grove street restaurant for tomorrow...
15/04/2023, 21:09 - Gracou: I am coming back tomorrow but disha has asked me to see her and her friend from Bcn x
15/04/2023, 21:22 - Gracou: When does ur term end? What’s the deadline?
15/04/2023, 22:35 - Théodore Bedos: I think it around 24/25th of May. But it will probably be more around the 1st if June if I get an extension
15/04/2023, 22:52 - Gracou: Okay x
15/04/2023, 23:32 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
15/04/2023, 23:35 - Gracou: Im just wondering

19/04/2023, 20:04 - Théodore Bedos: When are you planning to come back?
 I would like to start making dinner it would be nice that you time yourself to be there when it's ready
19/04/2023, 20:05 - Théodore Bedos: Also if on your way back you could get a tin of apricot in sirup it would be very nice
19/04/2023, 20:05 - Gracou: Im just finalising my submission right now
19/04/2023, 20:05 - Gracou: When do u want to have dinner ready?
19/04/2023, 20:22 - Théodore Bedos: I am gonna start now, so it will be ready in 20/25min I think
20/04/2023, 17:34 - Gracou: U might want to have dinner without me today x
20/04/2023, 18:27 - Théodore Bedos: What are you up to?
20/04/2023, 18:27 - Gracou: I have my dissertation presentation tomorrow
20/04/2023, 18:27 - Gracou: It still needs work so I need to stay until it’s ready
20/04/2023, 18:35 - Théodore Bedos: Ok
20/04/2023, 18:36 - Théodore Bedos: I was still on campus, I am gonna leave then

20/04/2023, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: Can you please print what I sent you
20/04/2023, 20:12 - Théodore Bedos: It would be very helpful
20/04/2023, 20:32 - Gracou: Just so you know this isn’t a very polite way to ask in English x
20/04/2023, 20:36 - Théodore Bedos: I realised it so that's why I sent another message to make it nicer.
20/04/2023, 20:36 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry
20/04/2023, 20:44 - Gracou: It didn’t really work and to say sorry instead of ‘Im sorry’ also sounds incencere in english
21/04/2023, 22:32 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
21/04/2023, 22:32 - Gracou: Look how different my dads weight is!
21/04/2023, 23:33 - Théodore Bedos: Compared to know or before he lost weight?
21/04/2023, 23:34 - Théodore Bedos: If you mean compared to know, it's not the really the best photo for that, you don't really see is body in the picture.
22/04/2023, 00:08 - Gracou: What?
22/04/2023, 00:08 - Gracou: You mean now not know
22/04/2023, 00:09 - Gracou: That is a picture in 2019- his weight seems much more than now
22/04/2023, 00:33 - Théodore Bedos: It does but that's a bad choice of picture for comparaison. You can't see him properly, he is far and hidden behind aunty Liza
22/04/2023, 02:16 - Gracou: Lisa*
22/04/2023, 12:30 - Gracou: If you have a chance please May you grab some dishwasher tablets x
22/04/2023, 12:30 - Théodore Bedos: Ok

23/04/2023, 11:57 - Gracou: Are you at the gym?
23/04/2023, 14:03 - Gracou: You made an offer on the white shoes right? X
23/04/2023, 14:03 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
23/04/2023, 14:03 - Gracou: Okay good
23/04/2023, 14:03 - Gracou: I thought again about it and it would be nice to have some light coloured heels
23/04/2023, 14:04 - Gracou: I need some anyway and if I have wedges they will be much more comfortable
23/04/2023, 20:06 - Gracou: would you be able to send a message to the girl asking why she is selling the shoes?

26/04/2023, 16:17 - Théodore Bedos: I sent them a polite email to ask them to reconsider and in the mean time I emailed Apetito to say that I accept their offer. In case Flare Bright reconsider I will just say to apetito that I received a last minute counter offer that I can't refuse.
26/04/2023, 16:18 - Gracou: I seee

03/05/2023, 14:47 - Gracou: I think that we are on our last toilet roll
03/05/2023, 15:35 - Gracou: Something has gone wrong w the electricity and I’m not sure where the fuse box is
03/05/2023, 16:21 - Théodore Bedos: The fuse box is in the entrance
03/05/2023, 16:21 - Théodore Bedos: On top of the door
03/05/2023, 16:21 - Théodore Bedos: You need to push back up the big switch
03/05/2023, 17:12 - Gracou: I went to joes instead x
03/05/2023, 17:45 - Gracou: Theo that was rude
03/05/2023, 17:47 - Théodore Bedos: You are rude. Do you think I don't here your little tone. To make me sound stupide in front of Jo next to you
03/05/2023, 17:47 - Théodore Bedos: It's silly to leave the house without electricity instead of fixing it
03/05/2023, 17:52 - Théodore Bedos: Was the washing mashing on when it happened?
03/05/2023, 17:53 - Théodore Bedos: If yes, was it a big wash?
03/05/2023, 17:55 - Gracou: Thé machine was on but it was just a normal wash.
03/05/2023, 17:56 - Gracou: You came on the phone already accusing me theo so I don’t think you have any right to say I was being rude
03/05/2023, 18:01 - Théodore Bedos: I am not accusing you of anything. I am just saying that it is irresponsible/ selfish to leave instead of fixing. I have other things to do too
03/05/2023, 18:16 - Gracou: I think that it’s really silly how much you are overreacting to this
03/05/2023, 18:20 - Théodore Bedos: Tom is coming in 1h/1h30
03/05/2023, 18:21 - Gracou: Remember to give him the blue letter

03/05/2023, 18:39 - Gracou: have you asked the neighbours whether their plugs work?
03/05/2023, 18:48 - Théodore Bedos: No
03/05/2023, 18:48 - Théodore Bedos: The plugs work when I unplug the dishwasher, washing machine and fridge
03/05/2023, 21:00 - Théodore Bedos: If you are not coming home for dinner you should probably stay at Disha's house. I guess there is no point risking it
03/05/2023, 21:03 - Gracou: Are u telling me not to come home?
03/05/2023, 21:05 - Théodore Bedos: I am telling you that WiFi is working your desk lamp is working and it should be fine but there is still a risk that things get worst later so if you are not even coming for dinner there is no difference between here and Disha's place except that Disha's place is less risky
03/05/2023, 21:07 - Théodore Bedos: You cab also ask for extension due to technical issue and provide the electrician bill as evidence

16/05/2023, 11:17 - Gracou: Grace & Darcy - please can you reply & sort this this week. The Open (Golf Tournament) is at Royal Liverpool this year. The tournament starts with two to three days of practise and then 4 days of tournament play. The dates are the 17th July to the 23rd July. I have 4 tickets a day and can probably use James’s tickets one day. Do you want to come, do you want to bring Theo & Aaron? If so what day or days? I need to give you first refusal so I can then invite guests on the other days. If it was me I would do one day or possibly two with your boyfriends and probably not the Sunday as it’s too busy

22/05/2023, 12:54 - Gracou: Also, my drillogram hasn’t arrived yet :/
22/05/2023, 12:55 - Gracou: I didn’t order that vest 😂😂😂
22/05/2023, 13:44 - Gracou: How much where our paris olympics tickets? X
22/05/2023, 13:54 - Théodore Bedos: No I did not
22/05/2023, 13:55 - Théodore Bedos: What?? Check your vinted. Maybe you bought something else and the lady made a mistake when sending it.
22/05/2023, 13:58 - Théodore Bedos: Me and my dad paid 120 per tickets for volleyball, and 140bper ticket for basketball. We got seats very close to the court for both.
22/05/2023, 13:58 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
22/05/2023, 14:56 - Théodore Bedos: I just discovered that Jimmy Butler is a big fan of Taylor Swift
22/05/2023, 14:58 - Gracou: Amazing
22/05/2023, 14:58 - Gracou: Did I send you the money?
22/05/2023, 14:58 - Gracou: I did and still no 😂 maybe Vinted sent someone my details by accident
22/05/2023, 15:18 - Théodore Bedos: That's me and my dad's tickets. Your dad wanted golf tickets. I think you paid me for them. I think they were 80 each for golf

Numéro de compte: 82333122
Bénéficiaire: Théodore Bedos
Adresse du bénéficiaire: 16 Grove St, Flat 8, Old Gaol, BA2 6PJ, Bath, GB
24/05/2023, 12:20 - Théodore Bedos: Can you send 992 pounds, please
24/05/2023, 12:24 - Gracou: Done
24/05/2023, 12:24 - Théodore Bedos: Amazing thanks
24/05/2023, 12:42 - Théodore Bedos: Any advice to give me before the visit?
24/05/2023, 12:42 - Théodore Bedos: Like is there something I need to ask in particular
24/05/2023, 13:02 - Gracou: Ask about water pressure
24/05/2023, 13:02 - Gracou: Ask if the apartment has already had tenants
24/05/2023, 13:02 - Gracou: Ask how much interest they have had in the apartment
24/05/2023, 13:03 - Gracou: Ask about the landlord, why is he letting this property
24/05/2023, 13:10 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks
24/05/2023, 13:38 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
24/05/2023, 13:39 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
24/05/2023, 13:39 - Théodore Bedos: Do you validate?
24/05/2023, 15:57 - Théodore Bedos: The flats are amazing, the issue is that I don't have a flatmate to leave with me. The dude from Apetito hasn't got the autorisation from his uni to work remotely, and I have not had answer from the person's I contacted on the buddy up section of apareroom
24/05/2023, 15:57 - Théodore Bedos: Spareroom
24/05/2023, 15:58 - Gracou: Get on Facebook and find some communities and put messages on
24/05/2023, 15:59 - Théodore Bedos: I did not find any for Trowbridge
24/05/2023, 15:58 - Gracou: It would make me happy to know that you’re living somewhere nice while we are apart
24/05/2023, 15:58 - Gracou: Very cool
24/05/2023, 16:02 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/05/2023, 16:05 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/05/2023, 16:05 - Théodore Bedos: It would make me happy too
24/05/2023, 16:06 - Théodore Bedos: I'll have a look
24/05/2023, 16:17 - Gracou: I think you should contact Uni of bath just in case, and also ask the HR team at apetito about it z
24/05/2023, 16:29 - Théodore Bedos: Already asked the HR team of apetito
24/05/2023, 17:24 - Gracou: They couldn’t help?
24/05/2023, 17:26 - Théodore Bedos: I already told you. They put me in contact with 4 people. 3 of them have already decided to live in Bristol. 1 of them is ok to live with me but is finishing uni in September. He asked his uni to work remotely but the first answer was no. He is chasing them but I should assume that it won't work.
24/05/2023, 17:59 - Théodore Bedos: The guy is saying that he wouldn't mind paying July and August and commute to notingham once a week. But we can't start in July. And he can't start in June because he has already paid his rent. So I would need someone to live with me and pay his rent for the month of June.
24/05/2023, 18:00 - Gracou: I see
24/05/2023, 18:01 - Gracou: When does Viktor have to give up his apartment?
24/05/2023, 18:01 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/05/2023, 18:01 - Gracou: What do you think of this?
24/05/2023, 18:04 - Théodore Bedos: Probably around early June.
24/05/2023, 18:05 - Théodore Bedos: Who is Jamie?
24/05/2023, 18:07 - Théodore Bedos: I think that's clearly a way to try to have a date with you without it to look like one. He probably hopes to revive the flame by bringing nice memories. 
I personally don't feel threatened at all so if you want to do it I don't mind at all. But clearly that's what it is.
24/05/2023, 18:07 - Théodore Bedos: Do you feel the need to hear him saying anything about that time?
24/05/2023, 18:22 - Gracou: Benas’ bff
24/05/2023, 18:23 - Gracou: It’s either that or he is trying to get back in my friend group
24/05/2023, 18:23 - Gracou: I don’t feel the need to hear anything from him but im kind of curious about what he wants to say and think it could be quite funny to see what he tries to say
24/05/2023, 18:24 - Gracou: I dont see myself being his friends
24/05/2023, 18:27 - Théodore Bedos: 100% not trying to be your friend. 100% trying to get you back. If he was one of the very rare man that would want an ex to be his friend with no desire behind, he would have not been a dick like he was with you.
24/05/2023, 18:27 - Théodore Bedos: You do what you want, but if you just want my opinion, it would be unhealthy
24/05/2023, 18:28 - Gracou: Are you upset babe?
24/05/2023, 18:28 - Théodore Bedos: Also, I think it's just like that last time when he sent you a text to try to have coffee with you. Just this time a bit more elaborate. It's summer and he is getting hornie, classic.
24/05/2023, 18:29 - Théodore Bedos: No absolutely not
24/05/2023, 18:29 - Théodore Bedos: Don't want to sound harsh. I am just working and I am trying to go straight to the point
24/05/2023, 18:31 - Gracou: Don’t worry
24/05/2023, 18:31 - Gracou: Im at dinner so should get off my phone
24/05/2023, 19:54 - Théodore Bedos: Do you have a friend that would have no accomodation in June?
24/05/2023, 19:54 - Théodore Bedos: Because he could stay at the place in Trowbridge and so I could have the guy from Apetito coming in July.
24/05/2023, 19:55 - Gracou: I can ask around but the short answer is no
24/05/2023, 19:55 - Théodore Bedos: Ok
24/05/2023, 19:57 - Théodore Bedos: By the way I asked Tom when are the worker coming to the appartements and he said the 6th. But our contract ends the 4th. So I obtained us to stay one extra night for free.
24/05/2023, 19:57 - Théodore Bedos: We can leave the 5th
24/05/2023, 19:58 - Gracou: Babe if worst comes to worst just secure the apartment for July and we will figure something out for where you can live in June I promise I can set it x
24/05/2023, 19:58 - Gracou: Yay great
24/05/2023, 19:59 - Gracou: I can get you to live at dishas in June babe
24/05/2023, 19:59 - Gracou: It will be cheaper rent wise anyway
24/05/2023, 19:59 - Théodore Bedos: I can't have the appartement for July, there is too much demand. If I am lucky enough to have one of them I would have to start in June.
24/05/2023, 19:59 - Gracou: Have you spoken to the landlord about the issue?
24/05/2023, 20:00 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/05/2023, 20:01 - Théodore Bedos: No because the landlord wasn't there, it was an agency doing the visit. And there are soo much demands that I don't want to risk to make it sound that my flatmate situation is uncertain because I will be less likely to be chosen.
24/05/2023, 20:02 - Théodore Bedos: I can't do what you are saying because there is too much demand anyway. He won't bother for sure
24/05/2023, 20:03 - Gracou: You can ask those questions about the landlord even if it’s an agency babe
24/05/2023, 20:03 - Gracou: Can u afford one month of rent for June if ur living at dishas for free?
24/05/2023, 20:04 - Théodore Bedos: But Grace, I can live in the place in June!
24/05/2023, 20:04 - Théodore Bedos: The problem is that the other guy does not want to pay for June as he is already renting somewhere else in June. He can only start renting in July.
24/05/2023, 20:05 - Théodore Bedos: So either I found someone else to live with me that can start in June. Or I start with him and either I pay is part in June or I found someone to replace him just in June.
24/05/2023, 20:28 - Gracou: Good point 😂😂😂
24/05/2023, 20:30 - Gracou: I’d just pay for June by myself and ask for just a small bit of it from the other guy
24/05/2023, 20:33 - Gracou: Could you afford it?
24/05/2023, 20:35 - Théodore Bedos: That's the ultimate option.
24/05/2023, 20:35 - Gracou: Ultimate?
24/05/2023, 20:38 - Théodore Bedos: Last
24/05/2023, 20:38 - Gracou: Ah
24/05/2023, 20:38 - Gracou: Would ur parents maybe help you?
24/05/2023, 20:39 - Théodore Bedos: They gonna tell me to use that account I told you I have
24/05/2023, 20:43 - Théodore Bedos: So I can afford it. It's just that compared to other options or starts to make it expensive. If we take the very nice appartement that is 1050. That makes maybe 625pcm bills included. I have a viewing for a spare room this weekend that is 500pcm bills included. Over 2 years, that's 3000 pound difference. If I add the dudes rent that's 3500.
24/05/2023, 20:43 - Théodore Bedos: And I would have to buy some furnitures as well, which I am not counting
24/05/2023, 20:43 - Gracou: Im a bit confused
24/05/2023, 20:46 - Théodore Bedos: Don't worry it's ok
24/05/2023, 20:46 - Gracou: Ok we can chat about it properly another time xx

08/06/2023, 22:35 - Gracou: But they should be in the house
08/06/2023, 22:40 - Théodore Bedos: Because you gave me Disha's key separately you must have separate the keys from the rest. Do you remember when you did that?

09/06/2023, 15:15 - Gracou: I need to get into toms house today

09/06/2023, 15:17 - Gracou: You could just say sorry

19/06/2023, 13:31 - Théodore Bedos: How much does the pub quizz cost?
19/06/2023, 13:53 - Gracou: £2

19/06/2023, 16:07 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
19/06/2023, 16:10 - Théodore Bedos: I live a shark fin girlfriend in white top
19/06/2023, 16:10 - Gracou: Live?
19/06/2023, 16:11 - Théodore Bedos: Love
19/06/2023, 16:12 - Théodore Bedos: Azim and I are going to brew house at 7 to book the place. You can come at 7:30 to have more time for packing.
19/06/2023, 16:12 - Théodore Bedos: Viktor is arriving a bit after the start so you can come even if you are late
19/06/2023, 17:54 - Gracou: Remember I don’t think I can come sweetheart
19/06/2023, 18:08 - Théodore Bedos: Yes but nothing is impossible for Vin Unleaded Petrol. So you'll make it
19/06/2023, 18:42 - Théodore Bedos: It is not on tonight
19/06/2023, 18:45 - Théodore Bedos: So don't stress. I am coming home now
19/06/2023, 18:53 - Gracou: Ok
19/06/2023, 18:53 - Gracou: Nari just called me
19/06/2023, 19:47 - Théodore Bedos: Are you okay. You said you would arrive home by 5:30. So I am worried now
19/06/2023, 19:52 - Gracou: Im buying food
19/06/2023, 19:52 - Gracou: It has been taking ages
19/06/2023, 19:52 - Gracou: I still won’t be home for a bit
19/06/2023, 19:52 - Théodore Bedos: Ohhhh, I was waiting for you to have food together
19/06/2023, 19:52 - Gracou: Oh
19/06/2023, 19:52 - Théodore Bedos: 🥲🥲
19/06/2023, 19:52 - Gracou: Are you cooking,
19/06/2023, 19:52 - Gracou: You didn’t tell me!
19/06/2023, 19:53 - Théodore Bedos: Because you told me you were arriving at 5:30 so I thought that we could discuss the option together
19/06/2023, 19:53 - Gracou: Most of the food is for glasto but I bought myself a pizza for tonight
19/06/2023, 19:53 - Gracou: But I would much prefer a proper meal
19/06/2023, 19:54 - Théodore Bedos: I was thinking that we can take takeways. But I can go get myself a pizza or cook you something.
19/06/2023, 19:54 - Théodore Bedos: When will you arrive?
19/06/2023, 20:12 - Gracou: Erm 20/30mins
19/06/2023, 20:33 - Gracou: Omw
19/06/2023, 20:33 - Théodore Bedos: Where you not already on your way?
19/06/2023, 20:56 - Gracou: 🚽
19/06/2023, 21:19 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks for transfer
19/06/2023, 21:19 - Théodore Bedos: Put the oven on please
20/06/2023, 08:49 - Théodore Bedos: Are you gone???
20/06/2023, 08:52 - Théodore Bedos: I can't believe you left me without a kiss
20/06/2023, 19:20 - Théodore Bedos: How was your first day of work? Is it nice?
20/06/2023, 19:21 - Gracou: We have been quite unlucky
20/06/2023, 19:21 - Gracou: We are working 7-7 at night every night starting tomorrow!
20/06/2023, 19:26 - Théodore Bedos: 7pm to 7am??
20/06/2023, 19:55 - Gracou: Yep 🥲
20/06/2023, 20:20 - Théodore Bedos: Wo that's awful!! Are you paid more because it's during the night?
20/06/2023, 20:20 - Théodore Bedos: Does anything even happen at 5am?
20/06/2023, 20:25 - Théodore Bedos: And that's a 12h shift as well, that's super long. Even during the day I would hate it
20/06/2023, 22:15 - Gracou: Yes and I have to do one less shift
20/06/2023, 22:16 - Gracou: Im making sure people don’t break in
20/06/2023, 22:16 - Gracou: Yes but now we have to stay awake allllll nightttt
20/06/2023, 23:03 - Théodore Bedos: Gracou the bouncer 😂😂😂
20/06/2023, 23:06 - Théodore Bedos: If it's really awful you can still quit and work for your dad instead. I am sure that's not a bad solution. So don't wear yourself out too much.
20/06/2023, 23:07 - Théodore Bedos: Did you take Tom's keys with you?
20/06/2023, 23:31 - Gracou: No x
20/06/2023, 23:31 - Gracou: 😂😂😂
20/06/2023, 23:31 - Gracou: It will be a good experience x
20/06/2023, 23:31 - Théodore Bedos: thanks
20/06/2023, 23:32 - Gracou: On thé 27th i have promised we will remove all of our stuff
20/06/2023, 23:32 - Théodore Bedos: From Tom's place ?
21/06/2023, 01:20 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
21/06/2023, 01:20 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
21/06/2023, 03:09 - Gracou: Yes
21/06/2023, 08:38 - Théodore Bedos: Ok
21/06/2023, 15:04 - Théodore Bedos: Is Andy with you?
21/06/2023, 17:21 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to Frome for a house viewing. Can you guess how long it takes by train?
21/06/2023, 20:20 - Théodore Bedos: When will you come back?
21/06/2023, 21:30 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
21/06/2023, 21:30 - Théodore Bedos: In your favourite place
22/06/2023, 00:27 - Gracou: No
22/06/2023, 00:27 - Gracou: How long?
22/06/2023, 00:27 - Gracou: 26th as I told you
22/06/2023, 00:27 - Gracou: Why were u at maccies?
22/06/2023, 08:06 - Théodore Bedos: 1h!!
22/06/2023, 08:06 - Théodore Bedos: Because I did a viewing in Frome and when I came back it was 9:30 and I was too tired to cook
22/06/2023, 08:13 - Théodore Bedos: Could you please drive me to Trowbridge in the evening of the 26th? It's for a viewing. 
I really need to do it ASAP because the viewing in Frome was very nice and so I just want to check this one before accepting the one in Frome.
22/06/2023, 08:18 - Théodore Bedos: Pretty please 🙏
22/06/2023, 10:43 - Gracou: That’s very long!
22/06/2023, 10:43 - Gracou: Theo I can’t commit to what time I’m coming home on the 26th bc Tom is driving me
22/06/2023, 10:43 - Gracou: So i can’t say yes to that
22/06/2023, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: Ok I understand.
But it wouldn't be before 7:30pm because I am working that day. So do you think you may be back earlier?
22/06/2023, 10:47 - Gracou: Im just not sure
22/06/2023, 10:47 - Gracou: Toms family business is here so we may need to help out that day
22/06/2023, 11:28 - Théodore Bedos: Ok, I'll go by myself
22/06/2023, 11:33 - Gracou: I may be able to help I just can’t promise it right now that’s all
22/06/2023, 11:34 - Gracou: Im quite seriously considering quitting at the moment
22/06/2023, 11:34 - Théodore Bedos: Why, what's happening?
22/06/2023, 11:35 - Gracou: Well all night I was literally doing bag checks confiscating drugs
22/06/2023, 11:35 - Gracou: Which isn’t even legal for me to do
22/06/2023, 11:36 - Gracou: And 12 hours is so long and I was literally falling asleep and I was freezing bc I wasn’t expecting to have to bring stuff for night shifts
22/06/2023, 11:36 - Gracou: And I am supposed to be asleep from 8-4 but literally woke up so many times between 8 and 10:30 until I got to the point I literally couldn’t sleep bc it’s so fucking hot right now
22/06/2023, 11:37 - Gracou: So I can’t spend 12 hours awake tonight confiscating drugs if I have no sleep
22/06/2023, 11:39 - Théodore Bedos: Feels absolutely awful. I don't see how that's doable without being on drugs. I have been in tents when it was not even hot outside and it felt like a Sauna so I can imagine how hot it must be for you. Plus the light, plus the noise... That must be awful.
22/06/2023, 11:40 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
22/06/2023, 11:40 - Gracou: Like if I lay on my bed for 10 mins
22/06/2023, 11:40 - Gracou: It creates a sweat imprint of my body
22/06/2023, 11:40 - Gracou: Ive just given up and am sitting on my chair outside the tent
22/06/2023, 11:40 - Théodore Bedos: You should be careful bout your migraines aswell my love. If you don't sleep you gonna have very bad migrains soon
22/06/2023, 11:40 - Gracou: It’s still boiling but at least there is a small breeze
22/06/2023, 11:41 - Gracou: The boys are trying to sleep but I need to come up with a strategy
22/06/2023, 11:42 - Théodore Bedos: How are your friends doing? Are they enjoying it?
22/06/2023, 11:42 - Théodore Bedos: Need to find yourself a sleep mask and just sleep outside the tent
22/06/2023, 11:42 - Gracou: I can tell Tom Keeps waking up rn but is trying to sleep
22/06/2023, 11:42 - Gracou: No bc I don’t want people looking at me in your pants
22/06/2023, 11:43 - Théodore Bedos: True
22/06/2023, 11:43 - Gracou: None of us enjoyed the shift last night
22/06/2023, 11:43 - Gracou: I don’t think they want to quit though so I’m going to talk to them about it when they wake up
22/06/2023, 11:43 - Gracou: I don’t want to let them down
22/06/2023, 11:44 - Théodore Bedos: If you want to come back but Tom is staying. I can drive your car to Glastonbury and you can drive back
22/06/2023, 11:51 - Gracou: Thanks I will let you know
22/06/2023, 11:51 - Gracou: I may be able to come up with another solution
22/06/2023, 11:51 - Théodore Bedos: YEAH THAT'S MAY
22/06/2023, 11:51 - Théodore Bedos: Didn't meant to use capital letters
22/06/2023, 11:51 - Théodore Bedos: Didn
22/06/2023, 11:52 - Gracou: Hmm?
22/06/2023, 11:52 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah that's maybe not the best solution, but just to let you know that if you need your bubu, I will hike all the way their and carry your back in my backpack if you need!
22/06/2023, 11:53 - Gracou: Thank you bubu that’s very sweet ❤️❤️❤️
22/06/2023, 11:53 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
22/06/2023, 11:53 - Gracou: So cute
22/06/2023, 15:50 - Gracou: I have decided to try to stick at it
22/06/2023, 15:51 - Gracou: The worst they can do is fire me for sleeping on shift
22/06/2023, 16:12 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, good luck babe. Be careful of migraines
22/06/2023, 20:44 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
22/06/2023, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: Nice 👍👍
23/06/2023, 02:00 - Théodore Bedos: How is your shift going?
23/06/2023, 12:43 - Théodore Bedos: How was last night?
23/06/2023, 13:23 - Théodore Bedos: Vous avez supprimé ce message
23/06/2023, 13:58 - Gracou: Hi babe what did you delete?
23/06/2023, 13:58 - Gracou: I feel asleep at the end
23/06/2023, 13:59 - Gracou: The final four hours seem to always be really hard
23/06/2023, 13:59 - Gracou: But I was on a less difficult job
23/06/2023, 13:59 - Théodore Bedos: During shift?
23/06/2023, 13:59 - Gracou: Someone tried to escape and joe tackled him tho
23/06/2023, 13:59 - Gracou: Yes
23/06/2023, 13:59 - Théodore Bedos: Ahaha very funny
23/06/2023, 13:59 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
23/06/2023, 14:00 - Gracou: This is hilarious
23/06/2023, 14:00 - Gracou: Did you go on a night out with nari and Viktor?
23/06/2023, 14:00 - Théodore Bedos: Because I sent it with the comment of Azim in our volleyball chat
23/06/2023, 14:00 - Théodore Bedos: So I deleted it
23/06/2023, 14:00 - Théodore Bedos: We played foot ball from 4 to 6 and then went for drink and food in pubs
23/06/2023, 14:00 - Théodore Bedos: Until 3am
23/06/2023, 14:01 - Gracou: Sounds more fun than my night!
23/06/2023, 14:01 - Théodore Bedos: It was very nice, and football was also very nice because the weather was great
23/06/2023, 14:01 - Théodore Bedos: But I made a huuuuge blister under my foot and now I can't walk
23/06/2023, 14:02 - Théodore Bedos: Azim too
23/06/2023, 14:02 - Gracou: Oh no
23/06/2023, 14:02 - Théodore Bedos: Did you manage to sleep today
23/06/2023, 15:15 - Gracou: Yes more than yesterday
23/06/2023, 15:15 - Gracou: Please can you ask azim if he wants my Swiss ticket?
23/06/2023, 15:17 - Théodore Bedos: He isn't going anymore
23/06/2023, 17:03 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
23/06/2023, 17:23 - Théodore Bedos: Don't hold anyone else hand!!
23/06/2023, 22:51 - Théodore Bedos: Good luck for your shift tonight. Don't put yourself at risk, if you see a druggy running away leave it to Joe the tackler.
24/06/2023, 04:01 - Gracou: Don’t worry I didn’t xx
24/06/2023, 04:01 - Gracou: Joe the tackler 😂😂😂😂
24/06/2023, 12:56 - Gracou: Missing you sexy x
24/06/2023, 13:12 - Théodore Bedos: Miss you a lot too
24/06/2023, 14:47 - Théodore Bedos: I want my cuuuuuuddleeeeeees 😡😡😡😡
24/06/2023, 16:55 - Théodore Bedos: Wiktoria came to COS to offer me some polish caramel. The boys at Cos told me not to tell you, but I wanted to let you know.
24/06/2023, 18:47 - Gracou: Why did they say not to tell me?
24/06/2023, 19:51 - Théodore Bedos: Because they all thought that she was very attractive and they thought you would be annoyed that a pretty girl come give me chocolate when you are gone
24/06/2023, 20:27 - Gracou: Haha that’s silly
24/06/2023, 20:27 - Gracou: Im not threatened by Wiktoria
24/06/2023, 21:06 - Théodore Bedos: I know that's why I am telling yoy
24/06/2023, 21:06 - Théodore Bedos: You
24/06/2023, 21:06 - Gracou: Did she bring you caramel bc she is leaving?
24/06/2023, 21:07 - Théodore Bedos: No just because she got the same for me last year and I loved them a lot. So she got them again from Poland for me
24/06/2023, 21:07 - Gracou: Aww that’s very nice
24/06/2023, 21:07 - Gracou: Is she staying in bath for the summer?
24/06/2023, 21:08 - Théodore Bedos: Very nice
24/06/2023, 21:08 - Théodore Bedos: Until graduation, which is the same day than you
24/06/2023, 23:18 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my beautiful love. I love you so so so much, I can't wait for you to come back and you are the most beautiful woman on earth. Lots of cuddles 😚😚😚😚
24/06/2023, 23:42 - Gracou: Awwwww ❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕
25/06/2023, 09:16 - Théodore Bedos: How was your shift tonight?
25/06/2023, 11:29 - Théodore Bedos: I am doing 2 viewing in Trowbridge today. They are the last one I do because I told the people from Frome that I would give them my decision on Monday
25/06/2023, 13:37 - Théodore Bedos: What a shit day, I confused the time of the meetings 'ad so I had to cycle to melksham from Trowbridge and the other way around to make it in time. I did 15,2 miles with my bike that has no gear on country lanes!!!!
25/06/2023, 13:37 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
25/06/2023, 13:37 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
25/06/2023, 13:38 - Théodore Bedos: And when I arrived to Melksham the guy was topless, completely hangover and the house was a mess
25/06/2023, 14:18 - Théodore Bedos: I ended up in field at some point
25/06/2023, 14:18 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
25/06/2023, 14:33 - Gracou: That seems very tiring :( but at least it was nice weather x
25/06/2023, 15:18 - Théodore Bedos: Awful weather, it was super hot and very windy. The wind made it soo much harder.
25/06/2023, 15:18 - Théodore Bedos: I just missed my train by 2sec. And now I have to wait 1h in Trowbridge
25/06/2023, 16:13 - Théodore Bedos: And now the train is delayed by 30min
25/06/2023, 16:13 - Théodore Bedos: What a day!!!
25/06/2023, 16:33 - Gracou: Oh baby that’s absolutely awful
25/06/2023, 16:34 - Théodore Bedos: I will need your attention at some point today because I need to make a decision between two flats and I would really like your opinion
25/06/2023, 18:55 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
25/06/2023, 19:50 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you say that?
25/06/2023, 19:51 - Théodore Bedos: I don't like where he is putting his hands
25/06/2023, 19:55 - Théodore Bedos: I need to have a call with you 
, when can I call you?
25/06/2023, 20:12 - Gracou: Do not hang up on me.
25/06/2023, 20:13 - Théodore Bedos: You were not very nice. I am trying to take a very important decision and you are trying to end the call quick. I have asked none of your attention since a week, just sent you a few texts here and then. I am very sad that the one time I am asking you something you act this way
25/06/2023, 20:20 - Gracou: It’s just the one time this week that I can go to see artists x I was just in the queue for the toilette which I needed to leave very quickly in order to see Elton John which is why I did all these horrible shifts xx I know it’s super important darling but I want you to be somewhere where you are most happy and to me it sounds like you will be most happy in the first place you told me about x this has changed my mind from what I orgininally thiught bc I wanted you to be somewhere rlly easy for me to access when I come visit you but it sounds like you will be happy there so that’s where I think you should be xx
25/06/2023, 20:20 - Gracou: Ofc it’s only just my opinion and I support wherever you think is the best place
25/06/2023, 20:23 - Théodore Bedos: Then tell me that you'll call me later rather than now. And I asked you today at 4:30. So don't make me believe that you didn't or will have 10 free minute since then.
25/06/2023, 20:24 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway, enjoy Elton John
25/06/2023, 20:24 - Théodore Bedos: Here is the video of the room in Trowbridge
25/06/2023, 20:24 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/06/2023, 12:43 - Théodore Bedos: Have you checked the room tour video?
26/06/2023, 13:50 - Gracou: I don’t feel that you have treated me with very much empathy. It’s cool that the room is big.
26/06/2023, 13:58 - Théodore Bedos: I understood your situation yesterday, I just don't think it justified the little effort you put on helping me.
26/06/2023, 13:59 - Théodore Bedos: Can you be more explicit please. Is it worth going for the big room close to work or in the nice city with the nice flatmate?
26/06/2023, 14:22 - Gracou: I don’t know theo. I already told you what I think
26/06/2023, 14:24 - Théodore Bedos: But that was before you saw the room
26/06/2023, 14:26 - Gracou: Theo if throwbridge makes you feel depressed then you shouldn’t live in throwbridge. It’s simple.
26/06/2023, 14:27 - Gracou: And showing me the room doesn’t mean much because you haven’t shown me the other room which means I can’t compare.
26/06/2023, 14:28 - Théodore Bedos: https://m.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16590469&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2Fmythreads_beta.pl%3Fthread_id%3D19820036_16590469%26listing_restrict%3D%26offset%3D0%26show_deleted_too%3D%26label_id%3D%26keywords%3D%26only_unreplied%3D%26folder%3D%26sort%3D

26/06/2023, 14:28 - Théodore Bedos: Great that's the sort of things I wanted you to ask me
26/06/2023, 14:31 - Théodore Bedos: It's not exactly in Trowbridge. It's in a little suburbs with pretty houses that is just outside Trowbridge. But there is no shop in it so it's kind of depending of Trowbridge's
26/06/2023, 14:31 - Théodore Bedos: Trowbridge
26/06/2023, 14:31 - Théodore Bedos: The place itself is not depressing, but Trowbridge city centre is
26/06/2023, 14:31 - Gracou: Im currently packing my things so I can’t look at this now
26/06/2023, 14:32 - Théodore Bedos: Ok
26/06/2023, 14:33 - Théodore Bedos: I probably won't be home when you come back because I am at work. 
Don't be scared when you come back if the door is open. There is a worker in the house. He is redoing the bathroom
26/06/2023, 14:34 - Théodore Bedos: He will be done in 2days
26/06/2023, 17:17 - Gracou: Okay that makes sense
26/06/2023, 17:17 - Gracou: I Will be back late anyway

26/06/2023, 17:49 - Théodore Bedos: What do you feel like having?
26/06/2023, 19:52 - Gracou: I just got home
26/06/2023, 19:52 - Gracou: Anything
26/06/2023, 19:53 - Gracou: Literally anything you cook would be lovely
28/06/2023, 13:43 - Théodore Bedos: Its ok tell her i feel close enough with her so that she doesnt need to say thank you
28/06/2023, 13:44 - Théodore Bedos: From Azim about the prosseco
28/06/2023, 13:59 - Gracou: Awww that’s really sweet
28/06/2023, 13:59 - Gracou: Thanks for sending a msg about it x
28/06/2023, 16:33 - Théodore Bedos: Double checking if you are going to be here for dinner?
28/06/2023, 17:08 - Gracou: Hmm I’m actually not certain
28/06/2023, 17:08 - Gracou: I have ended up at tennis
28/06/2023, 17:08 - Gracou: And I’m not sure whether we will go to drinks straight after
28/06/2023, 17:29 - Théodore Bedos: Alright
28/06/2023, 17:31 - Théodore Bedos: That's unfortunate for the tennis. I picked up this shift because you told me that you were working. I would have lived to play with you
28/06/2023, 17:31 - Théodore Bedos: Was the weather not too bad
28/06/2023, 17:31 - Théodore Bedos: ?
28/06/2023, 17:32 - Théodore Bedos: Let me know before 7:30 what you do for dinner
28/06/2023, 19:17 - Théodore Bedos: Where are you going for drinks? With who?
28/06/2023, 19:28 - Gracou: It was so so
28/06/2023, 19:28 - Gracou: I have good news! I presented well today so I’m allowed to get an employee
28/06/2023, 19:30 - Théodore Bedos: Who is gonna be your employee? Why do you need an employee if you are stopping your work in 3 weeks?
Well done for presenting!
28/06/2023, 20:23 - Gracou: Thanks!
28/06/2023, 20:23 - Gracou: I Will tell you about it when I see u!
28/06/2023, 20:36 - Gracou: Are you home baby?
29/06/2023, 16:14 - Théodore Bedos: Do you know where is my gift for Disha. I can't find it
29/06/2023, 16:29 - Gracou: Emelia took it to disha in Spain
29/06/2023, 16:29 - Théodore Bedos: Are you serious??? Without telling me?
29/06/2023, 16:30 - Théodore Bedos: That's nuts Grace. First you told Disha that I was offering it to her which breaks the surprise and second you take it in my back and I don't even have the pleasure to offer. Wtf!!!!
29/06/2023, 16:31 - Théodore Bedos: And 3rd, it was currently in sale at COS so I could have returned it and bought it again which would have saved me 40 POUNDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
29/06/2023, 16:31 - Théodore Bedos: Plus if just spent the last hour and a half looking for it !!!!!
29/06/2023, 17:37 - Gracou: Theo I didn’t have much of a choice
29/06/2023, 17:37 - Gracou: Disha sent Deanna to the house without asking me and asked for the package
30/06/2023, 11:33 - Gracou: Are you at work?
30/06/2023, 11:34 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, do you have any problem?
30/06/2023, 11:34 - Gracou: I was just checking

01/07/2023, 18:14 - Théodore Bedos: Would it make you feel better if we do something out tonight? Go see a movie or go have dinner in the pub where there is the fork 50% discount, go to the board game cafe, or else?
01/07/2023, 18:36 - Gracou: I made a plan and became much better with the best of my day :)

03/07/2023, 15:51 - Théodore Bedos: Yep
03/07/2023, 15:52 - Théodore Bedos: Can you ask your dad if he heard of any car deal?
03/07/2023, 15:55 - Gracou: How much do you want to spend?
03/07/2023, 16:34 - Théodore Bedos: Anything between 2k to 7k depending on the deal
03/07/2023, 19:18 - Gracou: Babe where should I plan to go after my week with Anna? X
03/07/2023, 19:19 - Gracou: Okay super - mike says don’t spend less than £1500 but that u can get a decent one for £3000 online
03/07/2023, 19:19 - Gracou: I Will speak to my dad also
03/07/2023, 19:19 - Gracou: But obviously the car will be nicer the more expensive u go
03/07/2023, 19:19 - Gracou: I Will tell mike ur budget and talk to him again
03/07/2023, 19:20 - Gracou: He says that cars are cheaper up north than down south so it can be better to buy them here x
03/07/2023, 20:14 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah I found a few around that price but I have no idea of what's a good deal
03/07/2023, 20:14 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks for doing all of that
03/07/2023, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: https://youtu.be/8pEg8NrdL_Y
03/07/2023, 21:43 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
03/07/2023, 21:43 - Gracou: My bday present from
My aunt
03/07/2023, 21:44 - Gracou: You’re welcome
03/07/2023, 21:44 - Gracou: So exciting! When is it out?
03/07/2023, 21:56 - Théodore Bedos: Very cute
03/07/2023, 21:56 - Théodore Bedos: Fall
03/07/2023, 22:05 - Gracou: Thats American 🤢🤢🤢🤢
03/07/2023, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: That's what it says on the trailer
03/07/2023, 22:55 - Théodore Bedos: Depends when is the end of the week with Anna
03/07/2023, 23:11 - Gracou: It means autumn
03/07/2023, 23:12 - Gracou: I think it’s the 2nd/3rd
04/07/2023, 00:00 - Gracou: Yes it’s the 3rd
04/07/2023, 00:27 - Gracou: Omg babe it just occurred to me that I forgot to tell you that im going out clubbing on the night of my graduation
04/07/2023, 07:38 - Théodore Bedos: Ok good to know
04/07/2023, 07:39 - Théodore Bedos: That makes me think that I have a shift on the 14th. I need to try to have it moved
04/07/2023, 12:38 - Gracou: Oh dear
04/07/2023, 12:38 - Gracou: Please can you tell me where I should plan to go after Anna’s thing
04/07/2023, 13:05 - Théodore Bedos: I am at work
04/07/2023, 13:07 - Théodore Bedos: It's complicated, it depends on what you want to do in France. If you are back the 3 we have only 7 days until Thailand. So we have 5o peak between Labastide, Berniere and Paris
04/07/2023, 13:29 - Gracou: Yes
04/07/2023, 13:29 - Gracou: How far are we from la bastide?
04/07/2023, 13:39 - Théodore Bedos: Can you remind me the name of the place where you'll go?
04/07/2023, 13:50 - Théodore Bedos: I am thinking that I would like to go to Labastide because I haven't been in a while. Maybe I could go down to on the 1st to go do a bit of skydiving in the centre of France. Then go down to were you are at pick you up on the 3rd and go to Labastide.
04/07/2023, 16:45 - Gracou: That sounds like a perfect idea xx
04/07/2023, 16:46 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
04/07/2023, 20:28 - Gracou: Would that work?
04/07/2023, 22:32 - Gracou: Can you check if I’ve had a package delivery x
04/07/2023, 22:32 - Gracou: Uniqlo x
04/07/2023, 22:35 - Théodore Bedos: I got it
04/07/2023, 22:35 - Théodore Bedos: I asked my mom for having the car she is gonna check the dates. I am gonna check how much it would cost to rent a car in Labastide
04/07/2023, 22:36 - Gracou: Okay thanks baby xx
04/07/2023, 22:36 - Gracou: Wooo
04/07/2023, 22:36 - Théodore Bedos: I booked our Thailand tickets from Bangkok to Phi phi
04/07/2023, 22:41 - Théodore Bedos: Where did you put the duvet that you used the other night?
04/07/2023, 22:42 - Théodore Bedos: I am cold
04/07/2023, 23:53 - Gracou: It should be in the room
04/07/2023, 23:53 - Gracou: Thank you x
04/07/2023, 23:57 - Théodore Bedos: Yes but where?
05/07/2023, 00:09 - Gracou: It’s a brightly coloured blanket babe if it’s there surely you will se it
05/07/2023, 00:10 - Gracou: If it isn’t there then it’s in dishas room
05/07/2023, 16:58 - Gracou: Babe on Friday you need to be really mean and make me get up early and work and don’t let me make excuses bc I need money for Thailand. Remind me of all the nice dresses I want to buy and all the nice food evenings we will have.
05/07/2023, 17:05 - Théodore Bedos: Sure I will
05/07/2023, 17:05 - Théodore Bedos: Why do you need money so badly now?
05/07/2023, 17:10 - Gracou: Well because I’m like £700 into my £1000 overdraft
05/07/2023, 17:10 - Gracou: So the money I will be paid by my dad won’t go as far x
05/07/2023, 17:28 - Théodore Bedos: You won't be paid more than 700? You started before me and you are being paid more. I have already made 1200 at cos so far
05/07/2023, 17:29 - Théodore Bedos: 1re you sure your math is right?
05/07/2023, 19:07 - Gracou: Of course I will be paid more than £700
05/07/2023, 19:08 - Gracou: But I’m £700 in my overdraft so I have to take £700 off of whatever I’m paid
05/07/2023, 22:32 - Théodore Bedos: I miss you lots, can't wait to see you tomorrow
05/07/2023, 22:37 - Gracou: Babe Taylor has added more places in Europe
05/07/2023, 22:38 - Gracou: But I still can’t get an access code 😭
05/07/2023, 22:40 - Théodore Bedos: Why can't you? Too late again?
05/07/2023, 22:41 - Gracou: It just says it’s closed :(
05/07/2023, 22:41 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
05/07/2023, 22:49 - Théodore Bedos: Conspiracy!!!!!!! 🧐🧐😤

06/07/2023, 17:16 - Théodore Bedos: Or I can cook you anything that you want and it will be ready for when you arrive
06/07/2023, 17:16 - Gracou: I am bringing us a bottle of champagne to celebrate xx
06/07/2023, 17:16 - Gracou: Let’s get bath sushi xx
06/07/2023, 17:16 - Théodore Bedos: I don't drink champagne 😔

06/07/2023, 17:18 - Théodore Bedos: Ok ok
06/07/2023, 17:22 - Gracou: Grrr I just realised I accidentally got tickets to bath spa when I meant to get ones for oldfield 😢
06/07/2023, 17:23 - Gracou: And I also just realised that I had bought a return ticket before so I’ve bought myself another ticket for no reason 🫣😭

07/07/2023, 14:51 - Gracou: Just curious
07/07/2023, 14:59 - Gracou: Instead of bringing Adam tomorrow I could hang out with him tonight? What would u prefer?
07/07/2023, 15:08 - Théodore Bedos: I think there is a misunderstanding because we ain't hiking tommorow
07/07/2023, 15:12 - Gracou: U said about the pub walks
07/07/2023, 15:13 - Théodore Bedos: I told you that I need to receive my hiking shoes first. So I said maybe Sunday but most likely Wednesday
07/07/2023, 15:30 - Théodore Bedos: By the way, you can go hang out with Adam, no problems
07/07/2023, 15:30 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks for letting me know👍

12/07/2023, 18:34 - Théodore Bedos: Wow, what a bitch
12/07/2023, 18:34 - Théodore Bedos: What did you tell her
12/07/2023, 18:35 - Gracou: She was like ‘you don’t even work here’
12/07/2023, 18:35 - Gracou: And she had been threatening to leave them a bad review
12/07/2023, 18:36 - Gracou: So I just started to say ‘I’m just asking you to please not leave them a bad review as they are a small business and it could really harm them’ and she was just like ‘no!’ Even before I could finish and stormed out
12/07/2023, 18:36 - Gracou: She was a big bitch
12/07/2023, 18:36 - Gracou: This is why people don’t like Americans they pull stupid entitled Karen shit like this
12/07/2023, 18:37 - Théodore Bedos: Was she black?
12/07/2023, 18:38 - Théodore Bedos: Was she there the whole time or did she left before you?
12/07/2023, 18:38 - Théodore Bedos: Was the manucure good for you at least?

12/07/2023, 18:57 - Gracou: Is it a good job?

And the other one is a consultancy startup company in manufacturing, (I did not understand exactly what is the job title), starting at 33k with a quick target of 40k after 1 or 2 year.

12/07/2023, 19:26 - Gracou: Not really, I could make a pasta bake if you like
12/07/2023, 19:26 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe I can make fajitas, that's faster
12/07/2023, 19:26 - Gracou: Eh Im not super in the mood for fajitas
12/07/2023, 19:29 - Théodore Bedos: Alright pasta bake then

16/07/2023, 23:40 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/07/2023, 23:40 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
16/07/2023, 23:41 - Théodore Bedos: I had screenshoted this for us. Thought that could help you.
16/07/2023, 23:42 - Théodore Bedos: It might be easier if someone can drop you directly to Liverpool lime Street rather than Hoylake
16/07/2023, 23:55 - Gracou: Thank you x
17/07/2023, 16:01 - Gracou: Hi I hope you’re having a good day
17/07/2023, 17:02 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
17/07/2023, 17:04 - Gracou: If I leave tomorrow I can be dropped at a station that is better than the hoylake one, but it means I won’t be there right for when your parents arrive - I would appreciate if you were okay with this 👍
17/07/2023, 18:43 - Théodore Bedos: When would you arrive?
17/07/2023, 18:43 - Théodore Bedos: I was having an interview earlier. I couldn't answer
17/07/2023, 18:52 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
17/07/2023, 18:53 - Théodore Bedos: It would be nice
17/07/2023, 19:09 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
17/07/2023, 19:09 - Théodore Bedos: You can literally just leave from West Kirby at 7 and be on time
17/07/2023, 19:10 - Théodore Bedos: You don't even need your dad to drive you to do that. You can take a Uber. I would pay for itf that's a problem
17/07/2023, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
17/07/2023, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
17/07/2023, 19:14 - Théodore Bedos: You can leave from your place at 7:00 take a Uber to Liverpool lime Street and be on time. You can even leave at 8:00, take the next train and just be a little late.
17/07/2023, 19:17 - Théodore Bedos: That's how long it takes to go to Warrington. 46min
17/07/2023, 19:17 - Gracou: My dad can’t take me to Liverpool lime street. Only Warrington. There aren’t any trains running from west Curby because of the golf.
17/07/2023, 19:17 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
17/07/2023, 19:17 - Théodore Bedos: That's how long it takes to stop by Liverpool lime Street. 20min extra.
17/07/2023, 19:18 - Théodore Bedos: How is that not doable?
17/07/2023, 19:18 - Gracou: My dad says he can’t do it because of his meeting. It is rude of you to ask
17/07/2023, 19:18 - Théodore Bedos: There are buses. I have sent you the train ticket
17/07/2023, 19:19 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
17/07/2023, 19:20 - Gracou: Have you bought that?
17/07/2023, 19:20 - Théodore Bedos: You don't even need it. You can just take a Uber to West Kirby, Hoylake, or Liverpool
17/07/2023, 19:20 - Théodore Bedos: No I haven't
17/07/2023, 19:27 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
17/07/2023, 19:27 - Théodore Bedos: I'll pay for it
17/07/2023, 19:32 - Théodore Bedos: Did you even check that before telling me that you would not come?
17/07/2023, 19:39 - Gracou: I am aiming to arrive at 12:40. I am at a dinner so can’t explain any further.
17/07/2023, 21:37 - Théodore Bedos: Are you free to explain now?
17/07/2023, 21:59 - Gracou: Hi Grace andTheo , will be thinking of you both tomorrow celebrating again only this time it will be Theo  special day with his family. Have a wonderful day and let’s hope the weather will be kinder to you all .once again very proud of you both for what you have achieved. Love Nan and Bamps 👨‍🎓👍🎉
17/07/2023, 21:59 - Gracou: Actually I would prefer not to talk to be honest
17/07/2023, 22:08 - Théodore Bedos: Can you at least give me a reason why you can't take a Uber to Liverpool or Hoylake and be on time?
17/07/2023, 22:11 - Gracou: Im being driven to Manchester which is an 1h20 minutes away because that is the quickest train. I can’t be taken to Liverpool. What do you think the chances are of me getting an Uber to Liverpool when everyone is here for the open? The fastest one is the one I’m doing.
17/07/2023, 22:22 - Théodore Bedos: Easy, there was plenty when I checked at 7pm. There will surely people being dropped off and so there will be some going back.
You can even call taxi company and book one.
17/07/2023, 22:23 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
17/07/2023, 22:23 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
17/07/2023, 22:24 - Théodore Bedos: It's just 30min faster
17/07/2023, 22:25 - Théodore Bedos: How is it worth doing 1h20 car rather than taking a 12min uber
17/07/2023, 22:28 - Théodore Bedos: Also you are gonna pay 40£ extra than if you went from Hoyelake
17/07/2023, 22:28 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
17/07/2023, 22:32 - Gracou: What time even is the scallop shell booking?
17/07/2023, 22:32 - Théodore Bedos: 12:15
17/07/2023, 22:37 - Théodore Bedos: I am gonna try calling the restaurant to move it to later
17/07/2023, 22:38 - Théodore Bedos: Or I will call and say that we are 15min late. And then order for you so that you can arrive when the food arrives
18/07/2023, 08:40 - Gracou: Please bring your portable charger with you
18/07/2023, 08:41 - Théodore Bedos: I'll do
18/07/2023, 09:33 - Gracou: Actually don’t worry I just bought a charger
18/07/2023, 10:28 - Théodore Bedos: I managed to change the reservation to 12:45.
18/07/2023, 11:10 - Gracou: 👍
18/07/2023, 11:44 - Théodore Bedos: Omg, Disha just take soooooo long in the bathroom. She is putting me late again
18/07/2023, 12:07 - Gracou: Theo you’re living rent free in her house
18/07/2023, 12:16 - Théodore Bedos: Bru, of course I know Grace, I am just joking.
18/07/2023, 12:16 - Théodore Bedos: It's because I know that every time it happen I never tell her to hurry or anything
18/07/2023, 12:16 - Théodore Bedos: It's just funny that she takes so long
18/07/2023, 12:43 - Gracou: I’m walking to the scallop shell now
18/07/2023, 12:55 - Théodore Bedos: Can I order cod fish and chips for you?
18/07/2023, 18:18 - Gracou: What time is dinner?
18/07/2023, 18:18 - Gracou: I am thinking of getting my mum to arrive here at 7 and then we will drive into town
18/07/2023, 18:20 - Théodore Bedos: Dinner is at 8
18/07/2023, 18:21 - Théodore Bedos: 👍
18/07/2023, 18:38 - Gracou: Babe that’s not a good idea
18/07/2023, 18:38 - Gracou: Then my mum will leave so late
18/07/2023, 18:39 - Gracou: It’s not fair to make her wait for an hour
18/07/2023, 18:39 - Gracou: Can we make it sooner?
18/07/2023, 18:45 - Théodore Bedos: I can call and ask if we could be a bit early if you want
18/07/2023, 18:46 - Gracou: Appel vocal manqué
18/07/2023, 18:46 - Gracou: What time are you suggesting?
18/07/2023, 18:48 - Théodore Bedos: I can try to call for 7:45, maybe 7:30 but I doubt everyone will be ready by then
18/07/2023, 18:50 - Théodore Bedos: When you said at lunch that your mum was coming at 7. I said great because dinner is at 8.
I booked it the evening after your graduation. I did not do it just now knowing that your mum would have to wait, babe.
18/07/2023, 18:53 - Théodore Bedos: Should I call?
18/07/2023, 19:09 - Gracou: As early as you can do would be great
18/07/2023, 19:10 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry I just called and I could not make it earlier
18/07/2023, 19:11 - Gracou: Right okay
18/07/2023, 19:12 - Gracou: Would you like for us all to go for a drink somewhere else? It’s fine if not as we can just stay here
18/07/2023, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: Do you mean before?
18/07/2023, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: Or instead of dinner?
18/07/2023, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: I don't understand
18/07/2023, 19:13 - Gracou: Before
18/07/2023, 19:13 - Gracou: We ask them if we can just have drinks beforehand
18/07/2023, 19:13 - Gracou: I am having a drink at the house rn so I’m not too bothered
18/07/2023, 19:14 - Théodore Bedos: I don't understand, who is asking to have drinks? Your mom? Isn't she driving?
18/07/2023, 19:15 - Théodore Bedos: Who is it when you say "us all"?
18/07/2023, 19:21 - Gracou: ??

18/07/2023, 20:02 - Théodore Bedos: Where are you now?
18/07/2023, 20:03 - Théodore Bedos: There is a problem now at the restaurant because they have only a table for 6 when we booked for 7
18/07/2023, 20:04 - Théodore Bedos: They are trying to find us a new table
18/07/2023, 20:10 - Théodore Bedos: I rushed everyone there because you said you needed it to be early. Where are you?

27/07/2023, 16:25 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to ask Will if maybe we can leave it in the underground of cos. Maybe Nathan can bring it there?
27/07/2023, 16:57 - Gracou: No Theo we can’t ask theo to take it all that way!
27/07/2023, 17:17 - Théodore Bedos: Ok, I was just checking
27/07/2023, 17:17 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe he was going in town with his car for something anyway and he didn't mind taking it
27/07/2023, 17:18 - Gracou: No we don’t have a right to ask him that at all
27/07/2023, 18:43 - Théodore Bedos: Ok

28/07/2023, 15:12 - Théodore Bedos: Show him my morning routine for tomorrow

28/07/2023, 16:55 - Gracou: Theo you didn’t tell me you were going to contact someone for this you need to get better at communicating
28/07/2023, 16:55 - Gracou: I told Nathan to throw it away bc he is sorting all the shit out at the house and doesn’t need another thing to do
28/07/2023, 16:55 - Gracou: I Will talk to him and see whether he still has it
28/07/2023, 16:56 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I am in the mountain... You told me yesterday, that's pretty impressive already that I manage to find time to ask Azim and Will
28/07/2023, 16:56 - Gracou: You could have told me that you were trying to do that
28/07/2023, 16:57 - Gracou: You said nothing about it when we talked about it
28/07/2023, 16:58 - Théodore Bedos: I did not even know if I would have time and connection to organise that until right now
29/07/2023, 00:28 - Gracou: Whesh
29/07/2023, 00:28 - Gracou: Also I do miss you quite a bit
29/07/2023, 03:38 - Théodore Bedos: I do too
29/07/2023, 06:54 - Théodore Bedos: Still not all the way up
29/07/2023, 06:54 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
29/07/2023, 06:55 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
29/07/2023, 06:55 - Théodore Bedos: This is crazy, I am climbing on my hands
29/07/2023, 09:40 - Gracou: Make sure you’re being safe x
29/07/2023, 12:00 - Théodore Bedos: It was quiet scary actually. I thought about you a lot
29/07/2023, 15:31 - Gracou: Aw
29/07/2023, 15:32 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
29/07/2023, 15:40 - Théodore Bedos: Nice
29/07/2023, 15:40 - Théodore Bedos: Is it in France?
29/07/2023, 15:41 - Gracou: Yes
29/07/2023, 15:41 - Gracou: We drove past la bastide
29/07/2023, 16:27 - Théodore Bedos: In the village or near by?
29/07/2023, 17:51 - Théodore Bedos: Did you asked Nathan if he threw the bin (and my shaver and pills) already?
29/07/2023, 18:18 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
29/07/2023, 18:18 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
29/07/2023, 18:18 - Gracou: Let me ask
29/07/2023, 18:18 - Gracou: Actually I did ask and he didn’t rely
29/07/2023, 18:18 - Gracou: Reply
29/07/2023, 18:19 - Gracou: He is really angry at disha atm
29/07/2023, 18:21 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
29/07/2023, 18:21 - Théodore Bedos: Seems very nice. Is it near Anna's place
29/07/2023, 18:22 - Gracou: Because every one that came to the house that is friends with disha has left shit in the house and he is the one that has to deal with it when he has a full time job
29/07/2023, 18:22 - Gracou: Yes it’s close by
29/07/2023, 18:22 - Gracou: Also he isn’t happy with how clean it is, I’m less sure but they have asked for a contribution towards their cleaning fee
29/07/2023, 18:22 - Théodore Bedos: I understand. I didn't mean to forget all these
29/07/2023, 18:23 - Théodore Bedos: Which part isn't clean because when we lived here you did more cleaning in the kitchen than they ever did. And I took every single bins out.
29/07/2023, 18:24 - Gracou: Yeah I agree but unfortunately I don’t think we have a right to push back on it if they asked us
29/07/2023, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: Sure, just let me know how much
29/07/2023, 18:26 - Théodore Bedos: By the way, I finished my 4th day today. I just have 3 left ! Never been that far before
29/07/2023, 18:27 - Théodore Bedos: I think I am gonna make it
29/07/2023, 18:27 - Gracou: Are you feeling tired?
29/07/2023, 18:27 - Gracou: How is your ankle?
29/07/2023, 18:33 - Théodore Bedos: Exhausted, but I think I got enough left to finish
29/07/2023, 18:34 - Théodore Bedos: My ankles are fine. My problem is my feet. I have blisters on my blisters.
29/07/2023, 18:38 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
29/07/2023, 18:39 - Théodore Bedos: I had a swim here today. It was nice
29/07/2023, 20:01 - Gracou: Oh dear - do u have plasters?
29/07/2023, 20:01 - Gracou: It must have been cooling for your feet
30/07/2023, 00:48 - Gracou: Did you see my sezane jungle ouch in your room? It has my laptop charger x
30/07/2023, 19:30 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I do
30/07/2023, 19:30 - Théodore Bedos: But it doesn't save me from the pain much
30/07/2023, 19:31 - Théodore Bedos: I have no idea. It can be as it cannot be in my room
30/07/2023, 19:31 - Théodore Bedos: I miss you lots
30/07/2023, 20:12 - Gracou: It can’t be in your room?
30/07/2023, 20:41 - Gracou: Yes Azim can pick it up if its before Friday
30/07/2023, 20:41 - Gracou: Can you let me know the plan
31/07/2023, 10:48 - Théodore Bedos: The plan is that I give to Azim his phone number and Azim message him to know when he can come. 
So I need Nathan's number please. And also can you ask Nathan to put my electric shaver and my pills that I left behind the mirror of the bathroom please
31/07/2023, 13:25 - Gracou: No, we will have to ask Azim to go in and get that himself
31/07/2023, 13:25 - Gracou: Nathan is also being angry at me
31/07/2023, 13:26 - Gracou: Ive asked Nathan about the number
31/07/2023, 16:34 - Théodore Bedos: Ok that's ok
31/07/2023, 18:06 - Gracou: Good luck for your last day tomorrow!
31/07/2023, 22:10 - Gracou: You can organise for someone to come tomorrow evening if you want
31/07/2023, 22:10 - Gracou: Can u tell Azim - Thats from Nathan
01/08/2023, 13:39 - Théodore Bedos: I finished!!!!!
01/08/2023, 13:40 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I can tell that. But Azim has his own schedule too. It would be so much easier if Azim could just chat with him directly.
01/08/2023, 16:35 - Théodore Bedos: I missed you so so much. Can't wait to see you in just 2 days
01/08/2023, 17:13 - Gracou: Congratulations!!!!! I’m so happy you’re safe :)
01/08/2023, 17:14 - Gracou: Theo your tone is rude
01/08/2023, 17:14 - Gracou: I asked Nathan and he is pissed and frankly I don’t want Azim discussing it with Nathan much
01/08/2023, 17:14 - Gracou: I Will give Azim his number at the time so he can call
01/08/2023, 17:14 - Gracou: Like I will send it now
01/08/2023, 17:21 - Théodore Bedos: It's not
01/08/2023, 17:21 - Théodore Bedos: So when does Azim has to go?
01/08/2023, 17:44 - Théodore Bedos: Do you want to see my blister? I did not expect it to be so big when I took the compeed off
01/08/2023, 19:02 - Gracou: It is, I would appreciate if you would make more of an effort on it
01/08/2023, 19:02 - Gracou: I am speaking to him
01/08/2023, 19:02 - Gracou: It’s a foot so maybe I don’t want it on my phone that much
02/08/2023, 09:34 - Théodore Bedos: When are you arriving in Paris tomorrow my love?
02/08/2023, 10:10 - Gracou: Im not sure yet x
02/08/2023, 10:20 - Théodore Bedos: Let me know because I need to organise myself for picking you up and I can't walk very well at the moment
02/08/2023, 10:24 - Gracou: Okay I will let you know
02/08/2023, 10:24 - Gracou: Do you think we can horse ride in the south? I would appreciate it :)
02/08/2023, 10:38 - Théodore Bedos: None of my cousins ever did horse riding around there are no place I know for sure. But I checked and it seems like there are a few horse centre around so we can call and see if they do ballades
02/08/2023, 10:38 - Gracou: Thank you baby
02/08/2023, 10:39 - Gracou: Okay so that means I will come earlier to paris but I just need to make sure of the timings with everyone
02/08/2023, 10:42 - Gracou: Is it best to book on sncf?
02/08/2023, 10:43 - Gracou: Or rail Europe?
02/08/2023, 10:43 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
02/08/2023, 10:43 - Théodore Bedos: SNCF connect
02/08/2023, 10:46 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
02/08/2023, 10:47 - Théodore Bedos: You didn't out the right Marseille train station
02/08/2023, 10:47 - Théodore Bedos: It's Marseille Saint Charles
02/08/2023, 10:47 - Gracou: Oh
02/08/2023, 10:48 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
02/08/2023, 10:49 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
02/08/2023, 10:50 - Théodore Bedos: Yes that's the right train station but you entered the place right in front of the train station as the departure rather than the train station itself.
02/08/2023, 10:50 - Théodore Bedos: Not sure it makes a difference though
02/08/2023, 10:51 - Théodore Bedos: I can go to the train station directly from the airport if you take this one
02/08/2023, 10:53 - Gracou: Okay so this is the best one?
02/08/2023, 10:54 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know the others. But if  you are ok with the price of this one then it's good 8
02/08/2023, 10:55 - Théodore Bedos: Did not meant to put a I at the end
02/08/2023, 10:55 - Théodore Bedos: A 8*
02/08/2023, 10:56 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
02/08/2023, 11:02 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it works too. But I would have to wait near 1h at the train station.
02/08/2023, 11:03 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe you can just take a uber to get to my house. It's not far from the station
02/08/2023, 11:41 - Théodore Bedos: So can you tell me when is Azim picking up the bin? Because he can't just drop it at Cos at any time. It needs to be when will is there and not Helen
02/08/2023, 12:16 - Gracou: Yes I can do that too
02/08/2023, 12:16 - Gracou: I spoke to Azim he hasn’t answered
02/08/2023, 16:17 - Théodore Bedos: Mana asked what you want for breakfast. Bear in mind that she can only go to the small grocery shop of the village so she can't get stuff like half brown and white bread but she can have baguette and Nutella or butter, biscuits, eggs, etc...
02/08/2023, 16:43 - Gracou: I Will est eggs
02/08/2023, 16:43 - Gracou: I have been eating eggs for breakfast and I like it :)

12/08/2023, 09:10 - Gracou: Hi Samuel! I hope you are having a nice day. 

Unfortunately, we are a bit disappointed with the Airbnb at the moment and would like to make sure you are aware of the following issues:

1. Only one guest is able to access the building. As the booking was made for two guests, we both need to access the building as we will not always enter and exit the building at the same time. 
2. Cleanliness of the room. The room has not been cleaned to an acceptable standard (photos attached).
3. Missing bed linen. The duvet does not have any sheet on it. 
4. Mattress. The bed is extremely hard and impossible to sleep on.

The above issues have been mentioned with you already. Unfortunately, we haven’t been contacted about a cleaner arriving today as discussed, and we have been given no resolutions for the other issues.

On this basis, we would like to request to cancel the Airbnb booking and receive a refund. We hope that you can understand where we are coming from.

Thanks,

Grace and Theo
12/08/2023, 09:20 - Théodore Bedos: Hi Samuel,

I trust you're having a pleasant day.

Regrettably, we find ourselves in a situation where we're a bit disappointed with the current state of the Airbnb. Our intention in reaching out is to ensure that you're informed about the concerns we've encountered during our stay:

Limited Building Access: Given that our reservation was made for two guests, it's proving inconvenient that only one guest can access the building. Since our schedules might not always align, having both of us able to enter and exit independently would be more convenient.

Room Cleanliness: It appears that the room hasn't met our expectations in terms of cleanliness, which we value highly. We've taken some photos to help illustrate the issue (attached for reference).

Bed Linen Missing: We've noticed that the duvet lacks a sheet, which is an essential component for a comfortable stay.

Mattress Comfort: The comfort of the bed has proven to be quite challenging, as the mattress is exceptionally hard and not conducive to a good night's sleep.

We'd like to emphasize that we appreciate your efforts as a host, and we believe you've been a welcoming presence during our stay. We also understand that maintaining a property can come with its challenges.

Given our mutual interest in ensuring a positive experience for both parties, we'd like to propose a solution that we believe benefits everyone involved. Considering the issues we've encountered, we believe it would be best for both of us if we could arrange a refund for the remainder of our stay and seek an alternative accommodation. This approach would allow us to find a more suitable place, and it would also prevent any negative impact on your Airbnb ratings or reviews. We genuinely believe you're a great host and we'd prefer not to leave a negative review for the property.

We understand that unforeseen issues can arise, and we're hopeful that this proposal aligns with your understanding of the situation. If you're open to discussing this further, please let us know the best way to proceed.

Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

27/08/2023, 04:13 - Théodore Bedos: But don't bother, just don't close the door.
27/08/2023, 04:13 - Gracou: You have such a mean tone when you text

29/08/2023, 11:57 - Gracou: These are just ideas of things he could get that are a bit different, there are many other possibilities Ford, Vauxhall, Citroen etc …… once we know what he likes then we need to find a good one. Don’t look at anything with more than 75,000 miles on the clock
29/08/2023, 13:06 - Gracou: Ok, all of them will be available in Auto. We just need him to decide what brand / model (s) to focus on

31/08/2023, 20:56 - Gracou: Oh no!!!
31/08/2023, 20:56 - Gracou: Is that from running too quickly?

01/09/2023, 10:05 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
01/09/2023, 10:05 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
01/09/2023, 10:06 - Théodore Bedos: It is 319£ but if I got the mattress as well it is giving me crazy discounts and so the bed becomes 210£ and the mattress from 450 to 340
01/09/2023, 10:06 - Théodore Bedos: So 550 in total
01/09/2023, 10:09 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

01/09/2023, 10:21 - Gracou: I think u did a good job of choosing a nice looking bed tho babe!
01/09/2023, 10:21 - Gracou: The light grey is deffo the safest option
01/09/2023, 10:22 - Gracou: So I would maybe recommend that one bc it will definitely not clash with things x
01/09/2023, 10:22 - Gracou: I think u did a great job picking a nice looking bed x
01/09/2023, 10:23 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
01/09/2023, 10:24 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks babe 😘
01/09/2023, 10:24 - Théodore Bedos: Have you heard of that brand though? DUSK
01/09/2023, 10:25 - Théodore Bedos: Is it good?
01/09/2023, 10:25 - Théodore Bedos: I am worried about the mattress
01/09/2023, 10:25 - Gracou: I haven’t heard of it before
01/09/2023, 10:26 - Gracou: I think it will be fine x check whether they have a 30 day trial period or something though!
01/09/2023, 11:13 - Théodore Bedos: They do have a 100 days but they don't have guarantee. Also the size is 150cm
01/09/2023, 11:22 - Gracou: Well you can just return it if you don’t like it in the 100 days?
01/09/2023, 11:22 - Gracou: What’s the problem with the size
01/09/2023, 12:03 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah I think I'll get this one
01/09/2023, 12:04 - Théodore Bedos: Just not soo big.
01/09/2023, 12:04 - Théodore Bedos: But I think it's fine
01/09/2023, 12:27 - Gracou: I’m only small I’m sure I’ll fit x
01/09/2023, 12:57 - Théodore Bedos: You are perfectly sized
01/09/2023, 12:57 - Théodore Bedos: Are you sure not to prefer the taupe one? I thought you would prefer
01/09/2023, 13:12 - Théodore Bedos: No you are right it wouldn't match any of my beddings
01/09/2023, 13:13 - Théodore Bedos: I bought them, will see how it is
01/09/2023, 13:23 - Gracou: 😘😘😘
01/09/2023, 13:24 - Gracou: I thought it might clash the wardrobe too x
01/09/2023, 13:24 - Gracou: I’m excited!!
01/09/2023, 14:48 - Théodore Bedos: For the curtain the pole will be 200cm large.
I can have a pair of full length and 116 cm curtain width in beige.
Or I can have full length and 116cm or 134cm in light grey like the bed. 
What's best? Less folds but beige or more folds but grey?
01/09/2023, 14:48 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
01/09/2023, 14:49 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
01/09/2023, 15:24 - Gracou: Hmm I think the grey to match the bed maybe x it’s safer
01/09/2023, 15:24 - Gracou: Not a huge fan of that pole
01/09/2023, 15:39 - Théodore Bedos: I have bought another pole
01/09/2023, 15:40 - Théodore Bedos: Are you sure about the grey? And then which width for the grey, because I can have less folds or more folds
01/09/2023, 16:18 - Gracou: More folds I think
01/09/2023, 16:18 - Gracou: It depends on what other colours you want in the room I think
01/09/2023, 16:20 - Théodore Bedos: I took them in grey with more folds
01/09/2023, 16:34 - Gracou: Okay goid x
01/09/2023, 18:33 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
01/09/2023, 18:33 - Théodore Bedos: Feel so weird to be here
01/09/2023, 20:56 - Théodore Bedos: Guys at the welcome drink thought I was Italian
02/09/2023, 00:25 - Gracou: Yes that is weird
02/09/2023, 00:25 - Gracou: For what reason?
02/09/2023, 07:00 - Théodore Bedos: I think because I was. Bit tanned and I was wearing my  army jacket that has a big collar on top of the navy mountain Hawaiian shirt from chatuchak. I guess that's a bit of a Italian vibe
02/09/2023, 11:30 - Gracou: I see - did u get a picture?
02/09/2023, 11:34 - Théodore Bedos: Nope but I looked cool

02/09/2023, 15:38 - Théodore Bedos: Although my dad told me that old cars may be expensive to repair because parts are more rare. So even though the porches are beautiful I will try to get something from 2010 to 2015
02/09/2023, 15:39 - Théodore Bedos: What sort of bed side table should I get? Do you think this is fine?

02/09/2023, 16:03 - Théodore Bedos: Also I installed the curtains and the shelves. I think I going to buy the same shelve again and put them side to side or make a corner
02/09/2023, 16:14 - Gracou: Which shelves?
02/09/2023, 16:15 - Gracou: The curtains don’t seem

02/09/2023, 16:20 - Théodore Bedos: The cloth rack
02/09/2023, 17:07 - Théodore Bedos: I just spent 250pounds on Amazon! I feel sick
02/09/2023, 17:09 - Théodore Bedos: I bought a bed lamp for 15, a cloth rack for 30, a shelf for 57, a bed side table for 30, a cloth rack for 75 and a nose trimer for 8
02/09/2023, 17:09 - Théodore Bedos: And a roller blind for 23
02/09/2023, 17:27 - Gracou: The wardrobe?

02/09/2023, 19:12 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
02/09/2023, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: On the first one I would put the shoes directly on the bottom of the wardrobes
02/09/2023, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: I have to put the desk not straight in front of the window because I won't be able to open it otherwise as my desk is too high
02/09/2023, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: That way I can open one side completely
02/09/2023, 19:14 - Théodore Bedos: I can put the book shelf against the other wall also. I have enough space
02/09/2023, 19:14 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

02/09/2023, 22:58 - Théodore Bedos: Just the first one, to my mom because she goes to chatuchak tomorrow. And I would like her to get me the bag that I missed
03/09/2023, 11:31 - Théodore Bedos: Don't you have any comments about the plans I drawn for you?

03/09/2023, 15:49 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
03/09/2023, 15:49 - Théodore Bedos: Don't know if you can see but they are tiny tiny, so cute 🥰
03/09/2023, 15:49 - Gracou: It’s the market
03/09/2023, 15:50 - Gracou: Awww
03/09/2023, 15:51 - Théodore Bedos: No, the song
03/09/2023, 15:53 - Gracou: What song is it?
03/09/2023, 15:53 - Théodore Bedos: Listen to it
03/09/2023, 20:34 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
03/09/2023, 20:34 - Théodore Bedos: Seems like I am gonna have a nice sun set every evening
04/09/2023, 08:08 - Gracou: Beautiful
04/09/2023, 08:08 - Gracou: It’s a good omen
04/09/2023, 08:08 - Gracou: I think this is maybe the best one
04/09/2023, 08:08 - Gracou: But do you need that much wardrobe space?
04/09/2023, 08:35 - Théodore Bedos: Because currently as it is I can only hang my jackets, coats, shirts and jumpers. I need another one for my t-shirts and trousers and maybe put some boxes with my underwears.
04/09/2023, 19:07 - Gracou: How was your first day? :)
04/09/2023, 19:21 - Théodore Bedos: It was ok
04/09/2023, 19:21 - Théodore Bedos: You know just a very long induction
04/09/2023, 19:21 - Théodore Bedos: I got my shelf today
04/09/2023, 19:21 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
04/09/2023, 19:24 - Théodore Bedos: Are you in Warrington?
04/09/2023, 19:45 - Gracou: My train just arrived
04/09/2023, 19:45 - Gracou: My dad is taking me for dinner
04/09/2023, 19:47 - Gracou: Ice shelf
04/09/2023, 19:47 - Gracou: Is it sturdy?
04/09/2023, 20:17 - Théodore Bedos: It seems very solid. It's the same brand as the wardrobe that we had in bath.
04/09/2023, 20:17 - Théodore Bedos: Nice 👍
04/09/2023, 20:17 - Théodore Bedos: Enjoy
04/09/2023, 21:58 - Gracou: Ah but you didn’t get the same wood colour?
04/09/2023, 22:02 - Théodore Bedos: I know, I thought it was when I chose it
04/09/2023, 22:03 - Théodore Bedos: It's not too choking
05/09/2023, 09:46 - Gracou: Have you watched one piece?
05/09/2023, 12:08 - Théodore Bedos: I have watched the 3 first episodes
05/09/2023, 12:08 - Théodore Bedos: Did you?
05/09/2023, 13:35 - Gracou: No of course not
05/09/2023, 13:35 - Gracou: I have restraint
05/09/2023, 14:12 - Théodore Bedos: Do you want me to stop watching?
05/09/2023, 14:12 - Théodore Bedos: Impressive
05/09/2023, 14:13 - Théodore Bedos: But you haven't been a fan for the past 15 years and at the same time having a lot of free time because you are alone in a new place
05/09/2023, 20:32 - Théodore Bedos: Can I call you?
05/09/2023, 22:34 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to sleep because I am working in the factory again tomorrow and so I need to wake up at 6am. 
I hope you can tell me about your first day tommorow.
05/09/2023, 23:43 - Gracou: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGJtcJysL/
05/09/2023, 23:50 - Gracou: No I don’t mind
06/09/2023, 20:11 - Théodore Bedos: https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/103118569468283/?referralSurface=messenger_lightspeed_banner&referralCode=messenger_banner
06/09/2023, 20:11 - Théodore Bedos: Can you ask your dad what does he think about this one?
06/09/2023, 20:12 - Théodore Bedos: I am negotiating and so far the guy is offering me 4000 and I am waiting for him to accept around 3700/3800
06/09/2023, 20:13 - Théodore Bedos: It is imported from Japan, the insurance would be 1300 so similar to other cars. And it costs 290 per year for the road tax.
06/09/2023, 20:13 - Théodore Bedos: I like it
06/09/2023, 20:14 - Théodore Bedos: I think it's a good mix between cheap, good looking, and reliable brand
06/09/2023, 20:15 - Gracou: My dad says it seems a bit dodgy bc it’s so cheap
06/09/2023, 20:16 - Gracou: It’s a good choice of car model
06/09/2023, 20:17 - Théodore Bedos: I agree but it was posted 3months ago and initially at 6999£. Now it's 4999£. So I think it's genuinely a good deal. Just the guy struggling to sell it.
06/09/2023, 20:18 - Théodore Bedos: I discussed with him and he said that he just started buying and selling cars
06/09/2023, 20:18 - Gracou: Isn’t that what the scammers say too?
06/09/2023, 20:20 - Théodore Bedos: I think scammers wouldn't be that honest. Also that's the only car he is selling on his profile
06/09/2023, 20:21 - Théodore Bedos: But I agree it's a bit ambiguous
06/09/2023, 20:21 - Théodore Bedos: But I have a good feeling about it.
06/09/2023, 20:22 - Théodore Bedos: From my experience selling bikes I usually feel the scammers
06/09/2023, 20:59 - Gracou: When did u starts building?
06/09/2023, 20:59 - Théodore Bedos: Building what?
06/09/2023, 20:59 - Gracou: Bidding
06/09/2023, 21:01 - Théodore Bedos: I first approached him 2 weeks ago. And today after discussing a lot with him about the car, I offered 3672 and he responded 4000. I responded with 3767 and I am waiting now
06/09/2023, 21:05 - Gracou: Babe with the random number thing I think it would be better to say 3670 and 3760
06/09/2023, 21:07 - Théodore Bedos: I agree with you, I thought the same but strangely it works. It's explained in the negotiation book I thought you'd like.
06/09/2023, 21:07 - Théodore Bedos: By the way he just accepted 3764£
06/09/2023, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: 🎉🎉🎉
06/09/2023, 21:16 - Théodore Bedos: I'll go on Saturday. It's in London. I know you are going to be busy seeing your friends.But if you are in London, would you mind accompanying me when I'll go try it and then potentially buy it?
06/09/2023, 21:16 - Gracou: 🥲
06/09/2023, 21:17 - Gracou: I was going to invite you to come to Devon
06/09/2023, 21:17 - Gracou: Congratulations!
07/09/2023, 10:40 - Gracou: I have spoken to mike at work
07/09/2023, 10:40 - Gracou: And he really thinks that you shouldn’t buy the car
07/09/2023, 10:41 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
07/09/2023, 11:52 - Gracou: He felt very strongly that it was dodgy
07/09/2023, 11:53 - Gracou: He said that just the fact it’s from london is enough not to buy it bc the way u drive cars in london is bad for the car
07/09/2023, 12:25 - Théodore Bedos: It's not from London, it was imported from Japan. The guy from London Vaughn it to sell it back so he hasn't drive it in London. Proof is that the vehicle is detaxed (I checked with the registration number online)
07/09/2023, 12:26 - Théodore Bedos: I am looking for other cars as well. If I don't find another deal I'll go just to check
07/09/2023, 12:37 - Théodore Bedos: It's actually from Manchester. I did not look properly
07/09/2023, 12:37 - Théodore Bedos: That's gonna be more complicate to check
07/09/2023, 12:38 - Théodore Bedos: In a place called Cheadle
07/09/2023, 12:39 - Théodore Bedos: That's so unlucky you are going to Devon, I could have come on Friday, check it, and then come visit you
07/09/2023, 14:07 - Gracou: We can speak about the car after work
07/09/2023, 14:11 - Théodore Bedos: Sure
07/09/2023, 17:40 - Gracou: Are you coming to Devon?
07/09/2023, 18:01 - Théodore Bedos: Depends on the car situation
07/09/2023, 18:01 - Théodore Bedos: I'd like too
07/09/2023, 18:24 - Gracou: So what is your plan for the weekend?
07/09/2023, 19:12 - Théodore Bedos: I find another car and it's in Derby. I am gonna try to go on Friday evening to buy it and then see if I can stay at Jim's place.
07/09/2023, 21:48 - Théodore Bedos: Jim is in Sam Diego so I am not gonna stay at his. I will try to come back with the car tomorow and come to Devon maybe in the evening. But nothing is sure because I may receive my bed this week end. I'll keep you updated
07/09/2023, 22:07 - Gracou: Don’t worry if it’s too tough to get to Devon
07/09/2023, 22:08 - Gracou: Do you really need to have a car this weekend?
07/09/2023, 22:09 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, first because it is really annoying not to have a car in Frome. I am wasting so much time waiting for buses and also I can't do much. 
But most importantly I managed to negotiate the car I will buy because I said I would come buy it tomorow.
07/09/2023, 22:10 - Gracou: Theo it takes time to find the right car you can’t rush it like this
07/09/2023, 22:10 - Théodore Bedos: I know it takes time, I literally spent 5 hours every day after work since Monday.
07/09/2023, 22:10 - Gracou: If ur going to rush it like this, you’re better off just getting a car for £1k that will last you a year but it’s not the end of the world when it breaks
07/09/2023, 22:11 - Gracou: It takes time to wait for someone to list the right one, not just to search for the right one
07/09/2023, 22:13 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I know, but this one is a great deal. It's a Toyota Yaris 2012. It was listed at 5500£ and I managed to negotiate it for 4600£. I check multiple valuation site and it is valued between 6200 and 6900£. I checked the MOT history and expect from the tyres it has never had any warnings. And it has only 39000 miles.
07/09/2023, 22:14 - Gracou: It’s not a great deal if it’s a scam theo
07/09/2023, 22:14 - Gracou: And everyone I ask with experience in buying cars says it’s a scam
07/09/2023, 22:14 - Théodore Bedos: You haven't seen this one yet...
07/09/2023, 22:15 - Gracou: Can u send the Toyota link please
07/09/2023, 22:15 - Théodore Bedos: https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/826307182489013/
07/09/2023, 22:17 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
07/09/2023, 22:17 - Gracou: You need to stop looking on Facebook and go to a trusted trader
07/09/2023, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: That's racist babe
07/09/2023, 22:17 - Gracou: He lives in Nigeria!
07/09/2023, 22:18 - Gracou: Why is he selling a car in the uk’
07/09/2023, 22:18 - Gracou: !!!
07/09/2023, 22:18 - Gracou: It doesn’t make sense!
07/09/2023, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
07/09/2023, 22:19 - Théodore Bedos: Oh, I live in Paris. It doesn't make sense either
07/09/2023, 22:24 - Théodore Bedos: I love you
07/09/2023, 23:35 - Gracou: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGJnjmbC2/
08/09/2023, 00:05 - Gracou: I Didnt know snoop had a wife https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGJnjawE2/
08/09/2023, 13:00 - Théodore Bedos: So I paid a service online to check the history of the car and it was a category S. Meaning it had a crash and was repaired. The history does match that the guy 2as saying because he said that he didn't crash it but he hasn't checked the previous owners. And the date on the report I got say that it was crashed before he bought it.
08/09/2023, 13:02 - Théodore Bedos: So overall it means that it is fine because the guy drove it for a year on 10000 miles mad had no problem has I checked the MOTs. But I don't want to have a category car as my first car as it is riskier. So I won't go to Derby this evening. 
Can I come to Devon still?
08/09/2023, 19:09 - Théodore Bedos: I made it to the train. I will arrive at 9:30
08/09/2023, 19:52 - Gracou: I Will be there to pick you up
08/09/2023, 19:59 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you my gorggorgitiful

11/09/2023, 16:31 - Gracou: It’s such a big difference I’m super proud
11/09/2023, 16:58 - Théodore Bedos: Beautiful
11/09/2023, 20:31 - Théodore Bedos: Not really, it's so unbalanced. They have no legs and all they can do is pull-ups
11/09/2023, 20:32 - Théodore Bedos: I forgot to tell you but the rice cooker broke. I took it of the box last week and it just never turned on.
11/09/2023, 20:33 - Théodore Bedos: So instead of buying a new one, I completely dismantled it and ordered some new thermal fuses. Like these
11/09/2023, 20:33 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
11/09/2023, 20:33 - Théodore Bedos: They arrived today. I reassembled it and now it's working again
11/09/2023, 22:46 - Gracou: Interesting
11/09/2023, 22:46 - Gracou: Oh booo
11/09/2023, 22:47 - Gracou: That’s very impressive boyfriend
11/09/2023, 22:47 - Gracou: Good engineering
11/09/2023, 22:48 - Théodore Bedos: It's not my fault. I did nothing with it. It just sat in a box for all summer and then decided not to work
11/09/2023, 22:49 - Gracou: I meant to say ‘oh noo’
11/09/2023, 22:49 - Gracou: But also at no point did I say it was your fault?
11/09/2023, 22:57 - Théodore Bedos: No but you said "boooo" which seemed like you booed me for breaking it
11/09/2023, 23:19 - Gracou: Well no
11/09/2023, 23:19 - Gracou: Even if I did maybe I would have just been saying boo bc it’s not good that it broke
11/09/2023, 23:19 - Gracou: But not booing you

13/09/2023, 08:05 - Théodore Bedos: I think you'll like this song
13/09/2023, 08:10 - Gracou: Good day?
13/09/2023, 08:13 - Théodore Bedos: Yesterday ?
13/09/2023, 09:09 - Gracou: So you have bought a new car?
13/09/2023, 09:09 - Gracou: I Will have to listen later
13/09/2023, 09:28 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
13/09/2023, 09:28 - Théodore Bedos: I did not steal it
13/09/2023, 10:01 - Gracou: How much did you pay?
13/09/2023, 10:01 - Théodore Bedos: 4200
13/09/2023, 10:04 - Théodore Bedos: The mechanic in the garage (the one I went to to check the car before buying it) was telling me it's a very good deal. He shown me the exact same car 1 year younger, also category S but with 95,000 miles instead of 40,000 for mine and he was servicing it for a guy that bought it 5,500£ last week
13/09/2023, 10:04 - Théodore Bedos: He said I can sell it tomorow for more than I bought. Or sell it in 2 year for the same price.
13/09/2023, 10:07 - Théodore Bedos: There are a few big scratches but honestly I don't mind. I am sure I will do some too.
13/09/2023, 15:04 - Théodore Bedos: Apparently I can fix some of the scratches myself. I could do that as a week end activity
13/09/2023, 17:28 - Gracou: That’s good news!
13/09/2023, 17:29 - Gracou: Did u have to pay the mechanic to go look at it ?
13/09/2023, 17:32 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I paid him 50£. It was really worth it. 
He took it for a ride with me, lifted it up and check under, tested everything. He even tried negotiating further down for me
13/09/2023, 18:49 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
13/09/2023, 18:50 - Théodore Bedos: Get to go to the hotel and have all my meals and transport expensed by Apetito because I am doing my induction in Newbury today and tomorrow.

13/09/2023, 21:05 - Théodore Bedos: Newbury is actually very nice. I went to a nice pub with Bea the other graduate that was sent here and we expensed everything. The pub was just next to a canal. Very mice
13/09/2023, 21:05 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

13/09/2023, 21:53 - Théodore Bedos: Nice 👍
13/09/2023, 21:54 - Théodore Bedos: Because I manage to find time to buy the car earlier in the week. I am free this weekend. But don't force yourself if it's difficult for you.  Just feel free to come if you would like
13/09/2023, 21:58 - Gracou: No I will come over 👍
13/09/2023, 22:00 - Théodore Bedos: Nice, but not sure i' ll have a bed because they failed to deliver today but they said it's delivered.

13/09/2023, 22:04 - Gracou: Oh no
13/09/2023, 23:19 - Gracou: Do you have wifi? Bc if I come I would come tomorrow evening and wfh on Friday probably
13/09/2023, 23:20 - Gracou: Bc I can’t afford the train and that way I could get my parents to drop me off
14/09/2023, 08:20 - Gracou: I need to know so that I can make a plan x
14/09/2023, 09:19 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I have wifif
14/09/2023, 09:19 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry babe I have been in a truck with a delivery man since 6am
14/09/2023, 09:38 - Gracou: Okay
14/09/2023, 09:39 - Gracou: When will you be back in Frome?
14/09/2023, 09:42 - Théodore Bedos: I will try to get the train at 15:15 so that I will be home by 16h45/5 but if I miss it maybe 6:30/7
14/09/2023, 10:21 - Théodore Bedos: If you come, bring a duvet. So that we can have one under and one above
14/09/2023, 10:48 - Gracou: I can’t bring a duvet x
14/09/2023, 10:48 - Gracou: Theo do you think maybe it would be better if you come to Warrington? Bc then we can sleep in a bed?
14/09/2023, 11:48 - Théodore Bedos: Not sure it's the best right now for me to come to Warrington. I just got the car, I haven't done all the declaration online yet. I would like to settle and check all that. Also I have food in the fridge that will expire. And I still haven't been to the gym or anything since I arrived from Thailand
14/09/2023, 11:49 - Théodore Bedos: Because I have been to Devon, then to Derby, now in Newbury. I would like to have time to do my washing and these sort of stuff.
14/09/2023, 12:13 - Gracou: I haven’t been able to do those things either fyi 🙃
14/09/2023, 12:16 - Gracou: Also, instead of coming today I will come tomorrow it’s more convenient for me with work
14/09/2023, 12:18 - Théodore Bedos: I can imagine
14/09/2023, 12:19 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, is your dad not coming down today anymore?
14/09/2023, 12:19 - Gracou: No but they can’t drop me off at yours
14/09/2023, 12:20 - Gracou: Yes they are but they can’t drop me is what I meant
14/09/2023, 12:22 - Théodore Bedos: So how will you come tomorrow?
14/09/2023, 12:23 - Théodore Bedos: I can come pick you up wherever they will pass by. If they pass by Bristol I can come pick you up there
14/09/2023, 12:25 - Théodore Bedos: That's quiet far actually but maybe we can find a solution.
14/09/2023, 13:22 - Gracou: I cant do that bc I need to stay up here for work tomorrow
14/09/2023, 13:42 - Théodore Bedos: Oh ok I thought you could do wfh
14/09/2023, 13:43 - Théodore Bedos: How would you come then tomorrow?
14/09/2023, 13:43 - Gracou: No something is taking longer than expected so I need to be in the office for it
14/09/2023, 13:43 - Gracou: By car in the evening
14/09/2023, 13:46 - Théodore Bedos: Alright

14/09/2023, 21:06 - Théodore Bedos: Any chance that your dad has a drill in Warrington that I could borrow when you come?
14/09/2023, 23:11 - Gracou: It’s a bit too late for me to be able to ask him but I can try
15/09/2023, 00:34 - Gracou: Sleep well xx
15/09/2023, 11:03 - Gracou: Are you asking bc ur bed came?
15/09/2023, 11:16 - Théodore Bedos: No for my blind
15/09/2023, 11:17 - Théodore Bedos: The bed situation is quite a mess. Almost made me cry yesterday evening
15/09/2023, 11:17 - Théodore Bedos: It's getting better now
15/09/2023, 11:17 - Gracou: Why isn’t it here?
15/09/2023, 11:24 - Théodore Bedos: Because I had to go to Newbury for work the day it was delivered

19/09/2023, 13:23 - Théodore Bedos: Oh no!!
19/09/2023, 14:58 - Théodore Bedos: Callum has COVID! Shit
19/09/2023, 15:00 - Gracou: FUCKSAKE
19/09/2023, 15:00 - Gracou: I wanted to tell him to stop coming in the kitchen when he said he had flu but didn’t feel it was my place bc I don’t live there
19/09/2023, 15:00 - Gracou: At least he took a test
19/09/2023, 15:01 - Théodore Bedos: I agree but he kind of have to eat and do is laundry type of stuff. He didn't chill much with us
19/09/2023, 15:01 - Théodore Bedos: I agree
19/09/2023, 15:02 - Théodore Bedos: I don't really want to stay at home now
19/09/2023, 15:02 - Gracou: Glad I cleaned the house
19/09/2023, 15:03 - Théodore Bedos: Is there anyone in the house in Devon? Do you want to isolate together in the annexe?
19/09/2023, 15:04 - Gracou: Ce message a été supprimé.
19/09/2023, 15:05 - Gracou: I have lived with people w covid before and not caught it
19/09/2023, 15:05 - Gracou: I don’t think we need to be that extreme
19/09/2023, 15:13 - Théodore Bedos: Just trying to find excuses for watching more one piece with you
19/09/2023, 15:14 - Théodore Bedos: But as you are stuck in a tiny apartment with your parent I thought you may not want to put them at risk.
19/09/2023, 15:17 - Théodore Bedos: And I am gonna work from home anyway because of it, so I thought why not together
19/09/2023, 15:23 - Gracou: I need to be in the office unfortunately
19/09/2023, 15:25 - Théodore Bedos: Are your parents in Warrington? Because I would be happy to come isolate with you in Warrington
19/09/2023, 15:25 - Gracou: Yes they are in Warrington
19/09/2023, 15:28 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, I guess that's the perfect occasion to show the world that I am COVID proof
19/09/2023, 15:36 - Gracou: Wait I’m confused
19/09/2023, 15:36 - Gracou: How do you mean
19/09/2023, 15:41 - Théodore Bedos: I have never had COVID. So because I have no other option than isolating in the same house than someone with COVID, I will finally have the opportunity to prove that I am immune to Covid
19/09/2023, 16:01 - Gracou: Ahh
19/09/2023, 16:01 - Gracou: Wel that comment could age very badly
19/09/2023, 17:23 - Théodore Bedos: I am negative by the way
19/09/2023, 17:23 - Théodore Bedos: I did a test
19/09/2023, 17:48 - Gracou: Okay that’s good
19/09/2023, 17:49 - Gracou: I don’t think it would show yet though there is normally a delay
19/09/2023, 17:49 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
19/09/2023, 19:10 - Théodore Bedos: I know but I have to for work
19/09/2023, 19:10 - Théodore Bedos: I thought I would let you know
19/09/2023, 21:15 - Théodore Bedos: Do you want to go see it together?
19/09/2023, 23:03 - Gracou: I think it will probably be bad
19/09/2023, 23:03 - Gracou: Yes sure
19/09/2023, 23:03 - Gracou: Im glad you’re okay so far
19/09/2023, 23:03 - Gracou: Miss you!
19/09/2023, 23:11 - Théodore Bedos: I miss you too
19/09/2023, 23:11 - Théodore Bedos: What did you think about the second episode of one piece?
20/09/2023, 00:00 - Gracou: I only watched a bit of it so far x
20/09/2023, 17:14 - Théodore Bedos: Love you
20/09/2023, 17:14 - Théodore Bedos: I went to the climbing gym yesterday. I completed 3 or 4 that I failed with you last time. It was good
20/09/2023, 19:50 - Théodore Bedos: https://youtube.com/shorts/94tT4cGRLeU?si=XF4jbt8BFP-HAzf_
20/09/2023, 19:51 - Théodore Bedos: Let's promess each other that the next time we live together we will take dancing classes, so that this could be us but obviously with better outfits
20/09/2023, 21:19 - Gracou: Ooo nice progress
20/09/2023, 21:19 - Gracou: But we could do a dancing class on the weekend too
21/09/2023, 00:00 - Théodore Bedos: True
21/09/2023, 00:00 - Théodore Bedos: Good night my love
21/09/2023, 00:02 - Gracou: Good night my sweetheart
21/09/2023, 00:02 - Gracou: Sleep well x
21/09/2023, 00:04 - Théodore Bedos: You too
21/09/2023, 07:52 - Gracou: Why were you awake?
21/09/2023, 10:32 - Gracou: A year ago today we were in Paris!
21/09/2023, 10:50 - Théodore Bedos: I was switching bank account and opening new saving accounts to split my salary into different pots.
21/09/2023, 10:50 - Théodore Bedos: Were we?
21/09/2023, 11:43 - Gracou: what are the pots like?
21/09/2023, 11:45 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
21/09/2023, 12:17 - Théodore Bedos: I have switch my main account from Barclays to Lloyd because they offer you a bonus of 175£ directly, better saving rates and other benefits. 
Then I opened a saving account in an App called Tandem, that I will use to put 90£ aside to save for my car insurance next year. While having a 5% return (which should give me 40£)
Then I opened a LISA to save for a house which give you a 25% return. I'll put 330£ on it per month and so it should make me gain 1000£ per year.
And then I transferred food money on my Revolut card. 
And the rest is left on the new Lloyd account to pay bills. It should leave me with 200£ for treats and/or unplanned expenses
21/09/2023, 12:19 - Théodore Bedos: Oh and I got what's left of my Dad's life insurance plus 25£/month that I will had to cover medical emergency or job loss on my chip account with 4,8%
21/09/2023, 12:20 - Gracou: Does LISA only work in the uk?
21/09/2023, 12:21 - Gracou: Is £200 enough for that? X
21/09/2023, 12:21 - Gracou: Remember you don’t need to pay for medical things here though?
21/09/2023, 13:01 - Théodore Bedos: I think yes, that's what should be left after I paid bills, membership, gym, fuel, etc... plus I got a cost of living allowance 70£/month that I did not count for safety
21/09/2023, 13:01 - Théodore Bedos: I know but in case I don't want to wait ages though NHS because of an emergency I would rather have a little fund.
21/09/2023, 13:02 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
21/09/2023, 13:03 - Théodore Bedos: For Hollidays I will use my end of the year bonus.
21/09/2023, 18:45 - Théodore Bedos: Bed scheduled for Monday 😁😁

21/09/2023, 23:26 - Théodore Bedos: You told me in Thailand to remind you that you want to take art classes in Warrington
21/09/2023, 23:30 - Théodore Bedos: And send me your bank detail so that I can send you the Revolut money please

22/09/2023, 16:30 - Théodore Bedos: Seems very cool
22/09/2023, 16:30 - Théodore Bedos: What's even more cool is my sexy girlfriend in stocking behind it 😍😍😍
22/09/2023, 16:31 - Théodore Bedos: The floor yes
22/09/2023, 16:32 - Théodore Bedos: How much and send me your details please
22/09/2023, 16:32 - Théodore Bedos: I just applied for my settled status by the way
22/09/2023, 21:43 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
22/09/2023, 21:43 - Théodore Bedos: New guardian ranking
22/09/2023, 22:41 - Théodore Bedos: How much?
23/09/2023, 01:10 - Gracou: ❤️
23/09/2023, 01:10 - Gracou: I Will send them on the train x
23/09/2023, 01:13 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
23/09/2023, 08:18 - Gracou: Exciting news Theodore Britos
23/09/2023, 08:19 - Gracou: The ones that looked good were in the thousands
23/09/2023, 08:22 - Théodore Bedos: Wowww
23/09/2023, 08:23 - Théodore Bedos: Citizenship is after. I can get it after 2 years of settled status I think
23/09/2023, 09:22 - Gracou: What will you be up to this weekend in the end?  X
23/09/2023, 09:32 - Théodore Bedos: I am gonna climb today and maybe go watch a bug rugby game with Callum in a pub. And tommorow I'll try to play basketball for the team in Trowbridge. They have an open session on Sunday
23/09/2023, 09:33 - Théodore Bedos: What about you?
23/09/2023, 19:27 - Théodore Bedos: Are you in London this weekend? Hope it will be nice
23/09/2023, 19:29 - Gracou: That sounds fun
23/09/2023, 19:29 - Gracou: Yes I’m in london I went to an ABBA concert today
23/09/2023, 19:44 - Théodore Bedos: Woowwwwwww, so coook
23/09/2023, 19:44 - Théodore Bedos: How come?
23/09/2023, 19:44 - Théodore Bedos: Why is it already done?
24/09/2023, 02:26 - Gracou: Wdym?
24/09/2023, 08:33 - Théodore Bedos: You did not tell me about it before so I want to know what are the circumstances. Did you just decided to go? Who are you going with?
24/09/2023, 08:33 - Théodore Bedos: Concert are normally in the evening. How come is it done by 7:30pm.
24/09/2023, 11:01 - Gracou: It’s been planned for ages actually and I have already told you about it I think :)
24/09/2023, 11:01 - Gracou: It starts at 3 bc we went to the early showing - it’s isn’t ABBA performing live, it’s 3D avatars
24/09/2023, 11:46 - Théodore Bedos: There is no way you told me that you were gonna go to a concert of 3D avatar of ABBA and I would forget it 😂😂😂
24/09/2023, 11:46 - Théodore Bedos: How was it? Did you go with Loli?
24/09/2023, 13:46 - Gracou: I did I mentioned it when I told u what I was doing this month when we have planned weekends
24/09/2023, 13:46 - Gracou: It was really cool, I went w Pooja, chris, Tom, ash
24/09/2023, 13:46 - Gracou: And then met up w more of my friends after
24/09/2023, 14:03 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/09/2023, 14:03 - Gracou: Any of these games*
24/09/2023, 14:04 - Théodore Bedos: Sure 😀😀 what's the deal?
24/09/2023, 14:04 - Gracou: Adam wants to sell them I think
24/09/2023, 14:04 - Gracou: He says he needs to downsize but they are all really good games
24/09/2023, 14:04 - Gracou: Which ones are you interested in? :)
24/09/2023, 14:09 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/09/2023, 14:11 - Théodore Bedos: I think I would like carcassone the most because it can be played up to 5 players but it's best with 2.
24/09/2023, 14:11 - Gracou: Ok
24/09/2023, 14:12 - Théodore Bedos: I am interested in the crew too but it says that the best configuration is with 4 People
24/09/2023, 14:12 - Théodore Bedos: How much is he selling it for
24/09/2023, 14:12 - Gracou: I dont know
24/09/2023, 14:12 - Gracou: Caracassone seems quite like catan
24/09/2023, 14:13 - Théodore Bedos: True, but I know it's a classic and it's good for 2 people unlike catan
24/09/2023, 14:13 - Gracou: Okay cool
24/09/2023, 14:13 - Théodore Bedos: Is Adam in London with you?
24/09/2023, 14:13 - Gracou: Yes I’m in his apartment
24/09/2023, 14:13 - Gracou: I slept on him and Andy’s sofa bed
24/09/2023, 14:13 - Théodore Bedos: Is he not leaving in Warrington at the moment?
24/09/2023, 14:14 - Gracou: No he left on Friday his project was just for 2 weeks
24/09/2023, 14:14 - Théodore Bedos: Oh ok, I was confused
24/09/2023, 14:15 - Théodore Bedos: Enjoy
24/09/2023, 14:15 - Théodore Bedos: By the way I sent that to your dad
24/09/2023, 14:15 - Gracou: Can you give me further game reviews x
24/09/2023, 14:15 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
24/09/2023, 14:16 - Gracou: Cool!
24/09/2023, 14:16 - Théodore Bedos: About these games?
24/09/2023, 14:16 - Gracou: Yes
24/09/2023, 14:17 - Théodore Bedos: I know splendor is a classic too but one seller actually recommended me the new duel version and told me it was better than the normal one. So I am more interested in the duel version
24/09/2023, 14:17 - Gracou: That makes sense
24/09/2023, 14:18 - Théodore Bedos: Dale of merchant 2 is actually best with 2-3 people but I never heard of it before and I don't like the design so much. It's about doing trades
24/09/2023, 14:18 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/09/2023, 14:19 - Gracou: Yes I can agree about the design
24/09/2023, 14:19 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/09/2023, 14:19 - Gracou: But look at the awards
24/09/2023, 14:19 - Théodore Bedos: Cute
24/09/2023, 14:20 - Théodore Bedos: You know, if you want it I will play any game with you
24/09/2023, 14:20 - Théodore Bedos: Just giving my preference
24/09/2023, 14:21 - Gracou: Okay thanks
24/09/2023, 14:21 - Théodore Bedos: And Kanagawa, I like the design but it actually had the lowest rating of all games here and it is said that it's best for 4 People
24/09/2023, 14:21 - Gracou: Interesting
24/09/2023, 14:25 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/09/2023, 14:25 - Gracou: Prices
24/09/2023, 14:26 - Gracou: Adam says it’s like star realms
24/09/2023, 14:28 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/09/2023, 14:29 - Théodore Bedos: Up to you babe, I am sure I'll enjoy playing any of them if it's with you.
25/09/2023, 13:40 - Théodore Bedos: Would you prefer to go to a virtual for 30£ or to an in person concert for 150£?
25/09/2023, 15:44 - Gracou: Wdym?
25/09/2023, 15:49 - Théodore Bedos: I am asking what would you choose to go to. A virtual concert if it cost 30£ or a real concert if it cost 150£
25/09/2023, 15:50 - Gracou: It depends on who is performing
25/09/2023, 15:50 - Gracou: And what type of performance?
25/09/2023, 15:50 - Théodore Bedos: If it's Taylor Swift
25/09/2023, 15:57 - Gracou: Real
25/09/2023, 15:58 - Théodore Bedos: If it's 300£
25/09/2023, 15:58 - Gracou: What’s the context here
25/09/2023, 16:03 - Théodore Bedos: No context
25/09/2023, 16:08 - Théodore Bedos: Just asking what you would prefer
25/09/2023, 20:23 - Gracou: I don’t like this question 😡
25/09/2023, 20:24 - Gracou: It makes me feel like your offering me taylor swift tickets 😭
25/09/2023, 20:24 - Gracou: Did your bed come?
25/09/2023, 21:37 - Théodore Bedos: Oh sorry, that wasn't the aim. I was trying to ask you a ' do you prefer to be a chair or table'  type question as you like
25/09/2023, 21:38 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it finally arrived and I just finished installing it. It took me 5h to assemble it, clean the mess and reorganize the room. I am exhausted 😩😩😩
25/09/2023, 22:21 - Gracou: I figured that out at some point but still 😂😂😂
25/09/2023, 22:21 - Gracou: Oh wow - did you get a picture?
25/09/2023, 22:24 - Théodore Bedos: I'll keep trying
25/09/2023, 22:25 - Théodore Bedos: Pictures don't make the room look very good so why don't we keep it a surprise for when you come
25/09/2023, 22:32 - Gracou: This is so cute https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGJvdrBm7/
26/09/2023, 11:50 - Gracou: Please can I use your hover to clean my car :)
26/09/2023, 12:42 - Théodore Bedos: Of course
26/09/2023, 12:54 - Gracou: What ingredients did you use in the uncle bens rice thing you made me the other weekend? X
26/09/2023, 12:56 - Théodore Bedos: Garlic, pepper, onions white, soya sauce, sesame oil
26/09/2023, 12:56 - Théodore Bedos: Spring onions
26/09/2023, 13:00 - Théodore Bedos: First heat the pan with sesame oil, then add garlic for 1min while steering. Then add half onions and half peppers for 1min30, then add rice. Mix until all mixed. Then add some soya sauce and sesame oil. More soya sauce than sesame oil. Stir fry for 1min. Remove from fire, add spring onions
26/09/2023, 13:12 - Gracou: Thank you xx
26/09/2023, 13:14 - Gracou: What’s the name of the rice packet baby?
26/09/2023, 13:14 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
26/09/2023, 13:16 - Théodore Bedos: I use Lidl fried rice actually
26/09/2023, 13:17 - Théodore Bedos: But I guess you can just go for uncle Ben's fries rice
26/09/2023, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/09/2023, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/09/2023, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/09/2023, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/09/2023, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: Babe help, please
26/09/2023, 18:26 - Théodore Bedos: I am in tkmax, you need to pick a duvet now
26/09/2023, 18:29 - Gracou: I was going to buy you one from m&s in linen as a gift x
26/09/2023, 18:29 - Gracou: Would you prefer to wait?
26/09/2023, 18:29 - Gracou: These ones are nice though
26/09/2023, 18:30 - Théodore Bedos: Wow that's very nice. For which occasion? That's very expensive
26/09/2023, 18:30 - Gracou: Just as a housewarming and a nice treat x
26/09/2023, 18:31 - Théodore Bedos: That's crazy nice babe thank you, I was gonna ask one for Christmas.
26/09/2023, 18:31 - Théodore Bedos: But I have none right now, so I probably need one extra anyway, no?
26/09/2023, 18:31 - Gracou: I’m confused
26/09/2023, 18:32 - Théodore Bedos: About?
26/09/2023, 18:33 - Gracou: I can’t really call now seeetheart x
26/09/2023, 18:34 - Théodore Bedos: The shop is gonna close, can you help me pick one please 🙏
26/09/2023, 18:49 - Théodore Bedos: Babe please
26/09/2023, 18:50 - Théodore Bedos: The blue stripe or green stripe
26/09/2023, 19:08 - Théodore Bedos: I bought the green one. I can still change it if you think it's bad. My reasoning was that in the picture on the green one there are black elements like in my room (desk, side table, wardrobe frame) where as on the blue one it's a lot more of brown colours
26/09/2023, 20:53 - Gracou: I like the blue xx but the black is a good point
26/09/2023, 20:53 - Gracou: I told
You here which one I liked
26/09/2023, 21:22 - Théodore Bedos: Shoot I did not see
26/09/2023, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: I agree the blue looked better but I think the green will suit the room better
26/09/2023, 21:30 - Gracou: Can you take a picture of it unopened next to things in your room
26/09/2023, 21:44 - Théodore Bedos: I'll tommorow, it's actually in the wash now
26/09/2023, 21:44 - Théodore Bedos: I made a mistake, I forgot that I told you I would wait for your approval and I just put it directly in the wash when I came back home
26/09/2023, 21:44 - Gracou: Good job 😂👍
26/09/2023, 21:45 - Théodore Bedos: Oups 🥲
26/09/2023, 21:48 - Théodore Bedos: Today I showed my manager the innovation organisational structure he told me to work on. And he told me that it was terrific and he loved it. Seems good so far
26/09/2023, 21:55 - Gracou: Wooo that’s great! How long did it take?
26/09/2023, 21:57 - Théodore Bedos: He asked me last week, but I have been on induction half and I was doing other jobs so  maybe 2/3 half days.
26/09/2023, 21:57 - Gracou: That’s cool
26/09/2023, 21:58 - Théodore Bedos: It's a very strange job, like it feel a bit like if I am building my company but I am actually in a company
26/09/2023, 22:44 - Théodore Bedos: Good night, I love you so much and I can't wait to see you
26/09/2023, 23:38 - Gracou: I miss you c
26/09/2023, 23:38 - Gracou: X
26/09/2023, 23:38 - Gracou: I love you x
27/09/2023, 09:26 - Gracou: morning handsome x
27/09/2023, 09:35 - Théodore Bedos: Good morning beautiful. What's your plan today?
27/09/2023, 11:12 - Théodore Bedos: Don't forget to watch one piece before you come
27/09/2023, 11:12 - Gracou: Which episode are you on?
27/09/2023, 11:12 - Gracou: Plan is to sort through files 👍
27/09/2023, 11:12 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
27/09/2023, 20:53 - Théodore Bedos: I have watched the 4th one
27/09/2023, 20:53 - Théodore Bedos: Not fun, how did it go?
27/09/2023, 20:56 - Théodore Bedos: I need to let you know that Ana started feeling bad today, she is poorly and is coughing quiet a lot. I think she got COVID but I gave her a test and it was negative. She said she was gonna go to her mom tommorow so that you can come in a virus free house. Callum does not has COVID anymore since Friday.
27/09/2023, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: So that's the situation, I don't have any symptoms but maybe I am carrying the virus too. So feel free not to come if you prefer.
27/09/2023, 21:01 - Gracou: Oh dear
27/09/2023, 21:03 - Théodore Bedos: Her test was negative, just precising
27/09/2023, 22:23 - Gracou: Okay
27/09/2023, 22:24 - Gracou: Will she keep testing?
27/09/2023, 22:39 - Théodore Bedos: Probably but it doesn't matter really had she will leave
27/09/2023, 23:20 - Gracou: But you have been around her babe
27/09/2023, 23:57 - Gracou: Us at the next family party https://youtube.com/shorts/QexrGwB-KNk?si=KZUGWlHTMVW3uuWH
28/09/2023, 07:16 - Théodore Bedos: I have also been around Callum and so far I have nothing
28/09/2023, 10:56 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
28/09/2023, 10:56 - Théodore Bedos: Just seen that, don't know if you are interested
28/09/2023, 13:38 - Théodore Bedos: Can you share your thoughts with me about what you think you'll do please?
28/09/2023, 13:54 - Gracou: I think I will come because I will miss you too much if I don’t see you for another two weeks on top of the two weeks we’ve been apart already
28/09/2023, 13:54 - Gracou: But also 😡 if you have covid
28/09/2023, 14:05 - Théodore Bedos: It's a risk
28/09/2023, 14:05 - Théodore Bedos: I appreciate 🙏
28/09/2023, 14:08 - Théodore Bedos: Would you prefer to stay in Warrington and I would come next week? It would mean no Frome market for you and no seeing eachother for 3 weeks now and the one time after.
28/09/2023, 14:08 - Théodore Bedos: But if you want this I can do this for you
28/09/2023, 14:11 - Gracou: I cant do next weekend as I already have multiple plans in london x
28/09/2023, 14:11 - Gracou: It is joe and Andy’s house warming and we are also doing a book club meeting
28/09/2023, 14:11 - Gracou: So it’s best probably if I just come to you this weekend x
28/09/2023, 14:37 - Théodore Bedos: Ok let's do that then. Thank you for coming
28/09/2023, 14:38 - Théodore Bedos: Will you come this evening or tomorrow? My room is 99% done now so you will have a better working environment if you want to come this evening
28/09/2023, 15:48 - Gracou: I Will come tomorrow x
28/09/2023, 16:01 - Théodore Bedos: Alright. Ana has left
28/09/2023, 17:39 - Gracou: Okay cool
28/09/2023, 22:10 - Théodore Bedos: Can't wait to see you tomorrow. I am preparing a lot of cuddles for you
29/09/2023, 09:10 - Gracou: I am excited to see you 😁😁😁
29/09/2023, 09:11 - Gracou: Would you be able to pick me up from sedgemore services? :):)
29/09/2023, 09:21 - Théodore Bedos: Are you not taking your car? Does that mean you won't stay Monday 🥲?
29/09/2023, 09:21 - Théodore Bedos: When?
29/09/2023, 09:24 - Gracou: Im asking my mum if she will pick me up on Monday but I’m not sure
29/09/2023, 09:25 - Gracou: Im not entirely certain, but I think it would be while you’re still working so I will have to probably wait at the petrol station 😂
29/09/2023, 09:25 - Gracou: But I don’t mind too much I can read or something
29/09/2023, 09:31 - Théodore Bedos: That's not ideal
29/09/2023, 09:33 - Théodore Bedos: It's 1h15min drive and I can probably be leaving by 4pm
29/09/2023, 09:33 - Théodore Bedos: So I should be there by 5:15pm
29/09/2023, 09:33 - Théodore Bedos: Could you ask your mom to drop you here instead. It's on the way to sedgemore station
29/09/2023, 09:34 - Théodore Bedos: https://g.co/kgs/hKo8t9
29/09/2023, 12:02 - Gracou: i will ask but my dad might say no
29/09/2023, 12:03 - Gracou: mmm ive checked and since it isnt a service station i think he will say no
29/09/2023, 12:03 - Gracou: as it us a 1h15 minute drive for you i understand if you dont want to do it i could just take my car
29/09/2023, 12:11 - Théodore Bedos: https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-vivo-rvo3&sca_esv=569441480&cs=1&hl=fr-FR&output=search&q=Asda+Petrol&ludocid=8231237947673395241&ibp=gwp;0,7&lsig=AB86z5VytL2JORdJgR99uqUhOmOT&kgs=601d341a340d390e&shndl=-1&shem=lbse,lsp&source=sh/x/kp/local/m1/4
29/09/2023, 12:11 - Théodore Bedos: It is a petrol station
29/09/2023, 12:12 - Théodore Bedos: It's because here I can get the special gas for my car. And it's extremely cheap here.
29/09/2023, 12:14 - Théodore Bedos: If I had to choose just in my interest, I would say take your car because like this I can train and prepare dinner before you arrive. Also you have a lot of bags that you left at my house from when I moved in from Disha's place. So it might be easier to bring them back (but I can also bring them up next time or bring them to Devon next time), and finally that means you can stay Monday.
29/09/2023, 12:16 - Théodore Bedos: But I am sure you already think to all of that, so if all together you thought that it was easier for you to come without the car. I will very happily come and get you but it would be better if it was at that station.
29/09/2023, 12:31 - Gracou: are you sure it will take you that long to drive to the first place i sent? its only 6k from frome x

29/09/2023, 12:40 - Théodore Bedos: When it will be 4/5pm with the traffic it will take maybe 1h30
29/09/2023, 12:41 - Théodore Bedos: What's the problem with the place I suggested? It's on your way to sedgemore services and you have a big Asda to keep you entertained
29/09/2023, 12:41 - Théodore Bedos: It's not gonna make much more road to your parenst at all
29/09/2023, 14:01 - Gracou: Im really not sure what to do
29/09/2023, 14:01 - Gracou: I think we can go to the Asda
29/09/2023, 14:02 - Gracou: But is it fair for you to have to drive 1h30?
29/09/2023, 14:03 - Théodore Bedos: Babe, you once came to get me at Bristol airport when you where in Devon. Of course I can do that for you

02/10/2023, 20:30 - Théodore Bedos: I am glad you encouraged me to go climbing, I completed the big red one that you filmes me on last time on my 4th try.
02/10/2023, 20:31 - Théodore Bedos: And then I completed 4 other difficulty number 5 like the red one.
02/10/2023, 22:30 - Gracou: Just arrived it was sooooooooo long
02/10/2023, 22:30 - Gracou: I don’t know how my mum did it

03/10/2023, 17:52 - Théodore Bedos: Interested
03/10/2023, 17:52 - Théodore Bedos: Clearance for 9pound in TK max
03/10/2023, 18:29 - Théodore Bedos: My tyre is flat 🥲 I am waiting for the help. Luckily I don't have to pay anything
03/10/2023, 18:30 - Théodore Bedos: I am in front of my gym, I could have waited while training but I forgot my sport clothes 😭😭😭😭
03/10/2023, 18:31 - Théodore Bedos: Well I am in front of a MacDonald so I guess I 'll have diner there
03/10/2023, 20:42 - Gracou: Yes very interested
03/10/2023, 20:42 - Gracou: What’s the size
03/10/2023, 20:42 - Gracou: Remember I’m bigger than you think
03/10/2023, 20:42 - Gracou: Oh no
03/10/2023, 20:42 - Gracou: That’s so unlucky
03/10/2023, 20:42 - Gracou: Where is that tkmaxx
03/10/2023, 20:42 - Gracou: Was it yummy
03/10/2023, 20:54 - Théodore Bedos: Size small
03/10/2023, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: A bit disappointed. I think I need to change my menu next time to enjoy it more when I'll go back to it
03/10/2023, 20:56 - Théodore Bedos: Just next to my gym in Trowbridge. It's where I bought my bed sheets
03/10/2023, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: By the way I received the linen bed sheets today. They are very soft, feels very luxurious. But I will have to wait to put them on as it's been less than a week that I have the green one on.
03/10/2023, 20:58 - Théodore Bedos: I'll go back tomorrow or Thursday. There was two of them so it should be fine

03/10/2023, 20:59 - Gracou: Ooo exciting
03/10/2023, 20:59 - Gracou: Can you ask Anna what size hers are by any chance?
03/10/2023, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: It is a small

03/10/2023, 22:50 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
04/10/2023, 00:04 - Théodore Bedos: I put it in the bag. I took it off your car when we loaded it with my stuff this summer.
04/10/2023, 00:55 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my love 😘
04/10/2023, 09:22 - Gracou: Oh I didn’t know I had it

04/10/2023, 11:16 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
04/10/2023, 11:53 - Théodore Bedos: Cute
04/10/2023, 13:45 - Gracou: Ive watched this before it’s super interesting
04/10/2023, 13:46 - Théodore Bedos: This particular video or the ones where he dresses up like other cultures?
04/10/2023, 13:47 - Gracou: Both x
04/10/2023, 13:48 - Théodore Bedos: Because the other videos we watched them together. But I had never heard him speaking about it
04/10/2023, 13:48 - Gracou: I had :)
04/10/2023, 14:42 - Théodore Bedos: Do you think it would be possible to have a Christmas in your family and one in mind this year? I would really like it. Like we could go to Paris from the 19th  to the 24th. Celebrate with my family on the 23rd then take the plane for Bristol on the 24th, be in Devon in the evening and spend the 25th, the boxing day up to the new year with your family. That would be just 6 days of leaves.
04/10/2023, 14:42 - Théodore Bedos: The plane ticket is just 68£
04/10/2023, 14:42 - Théodore Bedos: Tickets
04/10/2023, 14:43 - Théodore Bedos: If we warn them soon enough I am sure that my family wouldn't mind celebrating on the 24th. We have done it before
04/10/2023, 14:43 - Théodore Bedos: Mana has asked me if you would come.
04/10/2023, 17:07 - Gracou: in my family we celebrate on the 24th, 25th and 26th darling x its our tradition
04/10/2023, 17:08 - Gracou: maybe I can visit your family for a weekend a bit earlier in december and then we can both do our family christmases the normal way? x
04/10/2023, 17:09 - Gracou: I don't want to be on the plane on christmas eve also
04/10/2023, 17:24 - Théodore Bedos: The plane arrive at 2pm, you would have half the 24th , the 25th and 26th. You would just miss the morning of the 24th, it's not a big sacrifice to be able to have both Christmas.
04/10/2023, 17:28 - Gracou: is it the end of the world to do them separately like last year?
04/10/2023, 17:53 - Théodore Bedos: Sometimes babe you say things and I don't think you realise how hurtful they are.
04/10/2023, 17:55 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, I would really appreciate if I could spend Christmas with your family and you with mine also.
04/10/2023, 22:39 - Gracou: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGJcx3JYo/
04/10/2023, 22:39 - Gracou: But Theo you’re not realising that your sort of just making a demand of me without having a balanced conversation about what we both want
04/10/2023, 23:33 - Théodore Bedos: What do you want?
04/10/2023, 23:35 - Théodore Bedos: I thought if I offered you to have the 24th, 25th and 26th with your family while I would just have the 23rd with mine it would be 95% of what you want.
04/10/2023, 23:41 - Théodore Bedos: When you say that you can't because it's a tradition in your family. It's very hurtful babe because it seems like you don't realise at all the sacrifice I would do just to have you on the 23rd. In my family too it's a tradition to do it on these days, not just in yours.
04/10/2023, 23:44 - Théodore Bedos: Just to have you one evening with my family, I am ready to sacrifice the 3 most important Christmas days. But on your side, you wouldn't sacrifice half a day to have me in yours. Do you see that this is hurtful?
05/10/2023, 13:40 - Gracou: But i just think that we can both do our own christmases and then no one has to sacrifice
05/10/2023, 13:41 - Gracou: I don't see why either of us needs to sacrifice on our family time
05/10/2023, 13:45 - Théodore Bedos: Sacrificing is probably not the right word because I wouldn't feel like losing anything if I could have you with my family just one evening. I really want to have you there.
05/10/2023, 13:46 - Théodore Bedos: I really want to spend some Chrismass time with your family too
05/10/2023, 13:47 - Théodore Bedos: It would just be like winning. I would enjoy even more Christmas with my family if you are here and on top I gain spending time with your
05/10/2023, 13:56 - Théodore Bedos: I don't get it, it seems like you are not interested at all in spending time with my family. Almost like if it was a pain for you.
You are part of my family, Mana mad my parents have asked me if you would be there. It's hurtful to see that it's not reciprocal
05/10/2023, 13:58 - Gracou: I think that you’re escalating this.
05/10/2023, 14:48 - Théodore Bedos: No, I genuinely did not expected this reaction from you. It really annoys me
05/10/2023, 14:50 - Théodore Bedos: Imagine your parents are saying, why don't we do move out Christmas celebrations to the 23rd so that we can have Theo celebrating with us because he is family. And to that I replied, no I can't be bothered to spend half a day in the plane for you. How do you think you would take it?
05/10/2023, 18:54 - Gracou: But you didn’t even ask me theo? You just made this whole plan yourself without even asking me about it beforehand? You have just decided we need to spend our christmases together without asking me.
05/10/2023, 18:54 - Gracou: My dad says he is planning on taking darcy me and my mum to Florence at that time anyway.
05/10/2023, 19:02 - Théodore Bedos: Of course I asked you. What is that then?
05/10/2023, 19:03 - Théodore Bedos: I literally said, "Do you think it would be possible to have a Christmas in your family and one in mind this year? "
05/10/2023, 19:05 - Gracou: It’s not a genuine question if you’re only looking for one answer.
05/10/2023, 19:12 - Théodore Bedos: There are plenty of questions from which you expect the answer. 
Can I have ketchup with my burger? Could you help me scratch my back? Would you marry me? 
Should I never ask those because I would like you to say yes? What am I suppose to do then? Because I will always hope that you'll want to come on Christmas.
05/10/2023, 19:12 - Théodore Bedos: I did not even hide that I wanted you to say yes. I literally said right after : "I would really like it"
05/10/2023, 19:13 - Gracou: You’re just pushing me into a corner. This is so unfair. I said I would come visit your family at another time, but I would like to do my Christmas as normal.
05/10/2023, 19:16 - Théodore Bedos: I am not pushing you into a corner. You do what you want. You have already hurt my feelings
06/10/2023, 00:59 - Gracou: Goodnight boyfriend
06/10/2023, 08:13 - Théodore Bedos: Good morning
06/10/2023, 08:45 - Théodore Bedos: It's my dad birthday today, in case you want to send him a message
06/10/2023, 09:03 - Gracou: Thanks
06/10/2023, 22:29 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight babe
07/10/2023, 16:57 - Gracou: There is lots of daft punk playing here it makes me think of you!
07/10/2023, 16:57 - Théodore Bedos: Where are you in London?
07/10/2023, 16:58 - Gracou: Also

08/10/2023, 02:35 - Gracou: Woo!
08/10/2023, 02:47 - Gracou: What did you do today?
08/10/2023, 13:38 - Théodore Bedos: Seems like a very nice day
08/10/2023, 13:39 - Théodore Bedos: So did James Corden seen to be a dick in real life? Because that's his reputation right?
08/10/2023, 13:41 - Théodore Bedos: Yesterday was a bit boring. I was supposed to go climbing but then Jim told me he was coming tommorow. So I decided not to go climbing yesterday to be fresh for when he comes. But then I had nothing to do. So I decided to set up my PS4 and switch in my room.
08/10/2023, 13:43 - Théodore Bedos: This morning I played golf and it was so frustrating because I was so trash when Friday I was really good
08/10/2023, 19:41 - Gracou: Hi i can’t answer the messages right now properly but I was wondering if you could send me the funny car parking video
08/10/2023, 19:49 - Théodore Bedos: https://youtu.be/_-LIL1tsjpY?si=3X9cjs8VU5KNLjdj
08/10/2023, 20:08 - Théodore Bedos: I just sold the wide leg trouser from Thailand for 23£. That's a good profit!
08/10/2023, 21:15 - Théodore Bedos: So what would you like to do next week end ? I am coming to the north or to the south?
09/10/2023, 00:13 - Gracou: He seemed fine better than I expected but didn’t want to stay and talk to us just wanted to keep getting on w his day which is normal I guess
09/10/2023, 00:13 - Gracou: So did u see Jim today or tomorrow?
09/10/2023, 00:14 - Gracou: Wooo! They sold quickly as well
09/10/2023, 00:14 - Gracou: Let’s go to the south x
09/10/2023, 07:48 - Théodore Bedos: Alright 👌
09/10/2023, 10:37 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I climbed with him yesterday. Maybe today also. 
I was worried he was gonna trash me. Actually we were exactly the same level.
09/10/2023, 10:37 - Théodore Bedos: So that was fun
09/10/2023, 10:39 - Gracou: Oh it’s good that you have been practising then
09/10/2023, 10:39 - Gracou: I am missing you
09/10/2023, 10:39 - Gracou: Is he staying at your house?
09/10/2023, 10:40 - Théodore Bedos: No, he is staying at Elena's parent place with her in Corsham
09/10/2023, 10:40 - Théodore Bedos: It's 45min away from me
09/10/2023, 10:40 - Théodore Bedos: I am missing you too
09/10/2023, 10:40 - Gracou: Are you picking him up in your car?
09/10/2023, 10:41 - Théodore Bedos: He came with his car.
09/10/2023, 10:41 - Théodore Bedos: Today I might go to him
09/10/2023, 10:41 - Gracou: Ah
09/10/2023, 12:44 - Théodore Bedos: When do you think you'll go to Devon ? Thursday evening or Friday?
09/10/2023, 13:28 - Gracou: Thursday I think
09/10/2023, 13:34 - Théodore Bedos: Cool
09/10/2023, 13:35 - Théodore Bedos: I can probably come in the evening if that's ok
09/10/2023, 13:43 - Gracou: Wait nevermind
09/10/2023, 13:44 - Gracou: Im going to an event on Thursday actually so won’t go to Devon until Friday
09/10/2023, 20:04 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, Friday then 👍
09/10/2023, 20:04 - Théodore Bedos: What's your event?
09/10/2023, 20:04 - Gracou: My dad is taking me to something to do with property investors I think?
09/10/2023, 20:04 - Gracou: Im not 100% certain
09/10/2023, 20:05 - Gracou: To be honest, it’s the kind of thing I should be doing much more often in order to network
09/10/2023, 20:05 - Théodore Bedos: I hope I can stay Monday because there is the best game of the rugby world cup on Sunday evening and I don't want to miss it. So if I can't stay Monday I will leave by 4pm on Sunday
09/10/2023, 20:06 - Théodore Bedos: Seems very nice 👍 good idea
09/10/2023, 20:06 - Théodore Bedos: Hope it'll be helpful
09/10/2023, 20:08 - Gracou: My dad was asking whether you want to play golf on Saturday?
09/10/2023, 20:08 - Gracou: I Will have to check with my parents when they are planning to leave

18/10/2023, 21:44 - Gracou: I dont even think I will be done tomorrow 🥺😬😬😬 i Will have to do more over the weekend bc I don’t want to work from home for another week really
18/10/2023, 21:56 - Théodore Bedos: I will be working Friday so where is the problem if you are sorting your stuff? I will play gold on Saturday also so that's also plenty of time when you can do it.
18/10/2023, 21:59 - Gracou: Yes because I can only sort my things out in the evening and All tomorrow evening I will need to sort my things so I won’t be able to do things with you
18/10/2023, 22:04 - Théodore Bedos: It's ok, tommorow after work I will go to the gym take my time, and then go directly to Devon so I will arrive around 9h30/10h. So it doesn't matter if you need to take the evening

19/10/2023, 02:09 - Gracou: Baby do you know any salmon recipes?
19/10/2023, 07:33 - Théodore Bedos: What piece of salmon do you I have?
19/10/2023, 08:55 - Gracou: I dont however apparently it’s really good for you and you should eat it twice a a week
19/10/2023, 08:58 - Théodore Bedos: Fat fish in general is amazing. You could eat it everyday you would see the benefits. That's why I used to eat mackerel at lunch every day
19/10/2023, 08:58 - Théodore Bedos: I would eat salmon all the time if I had more money
19/10/2023, 10:27 - Gracou: yes but salmon is the only fatty fish i think i could grow to like to eat
19/10/2023, 10:28 - Gracou: so i'm thinking of setting a goal to try to eat it once a week
19/10/2023, 10:28 - Gracou: apparenty if you don't eat fatty fish twice a week its like asking your brain to function at 25% less capacity
19/10/2023, 10:28 - Théodore Bedos: Alright I will do some for you this weekend
19/10/2023, 10:29 - Théodore Bedos: What's your source?
19/10/2023, 10:30 - Gracou: A podcast that was a scientist lady and a doctor
19/10/2023, 10:30 - Gracou: i think that in my life ive not treated my gut very well and have seen a big differene in my wellbeing since i started eating more vegetables and plants
19/10/2023, 10:31 - Gracou: and plants really influences your gut
19/10/2023, 10:31 - Théodore Bedos: Is this about the ZOE app?
19/10/2023, 10:31 - Gracou: so i feel like my body is telling me it likes when i look after my gut
19/10/2023, 10:31 - Gracou: nope
19/10/2023, 10:32 - Théodore Bedos: What is the name of the doctor?
19/10/2023, 10:32 - Gracou: i can send you a youtube vieo that has the summary of the podcast
19/10/2023, 10:32 - Gracou: https://youtu.be/E3QpXj_QOqQ?si=rm6LkcIN_aSEP8vF
19/10/2023, 10:33 - Théodore Bedos: I think that's very legit but not as much as they say
19/10/2023, 10:33 - Gracou: Yeah I’m just thinking I should improve 🤷‍♀️
19/10/2023, 10:33 - Gracou: thats just my personal experience
19/10/2023, 10:34 - Théodore Bedos: It's true I read papers about it  when I studied nutrition. But at the moment there is a trend about it and I think they exaggerate it too much.
19/10/2023, 10:35 - Gracou: i thought to myself i dont really have any sources of omega 3 anyway and since i get migraines i would like to look after my brain even if its not connected
19/10/2023, 10:35 - Gracou: so salmon is good
19/10/2023, 10:40 - Théodore Bedos: It is but I just want you to nuance a bit what they are saying. 

For example in the podcast I listened, the doctor was also saying that protein were useless, and that calories where not important and that you should eat tones of nuts to help your guts. Bad I think he was saying that to amphasis the importance of guts. When I think it's not right because if you start doing exactly what he said you may have a happy gut but you'll be fat. Also I discovered after that his app ZOE costs 300£ a year so it make sense that he was exaggerating
19/10/2023, 10:41 - Gracou: theo i find this reaction really weird
19/10/2023, 10:41 - Théodore Bedos: What?
19/10/2023, 10:41 - Gracou: im not turning around and saying 'ive watched this podcast and now im going to change my entire life he is jesus'. im just saying that it made me think a little about my diet and that i want to try eating salmon more
19/10/2023, 10:42 - Gracou: i don't need to be told that health nerds like to big up their opinions and are often wrong
19/10/2023, 10:43 - Gracou: as someone that is encouraging me to be healthier, i dont get why you are meeting this with negativity instead of just being happy i was interested to learn about it and that im doing a small action to improve my nutritional intake
19/10/2023, 10:43 - Gracou: it feels like you just want to show off your opinion like always when someone talks about nutrition
19/10/2023, 10:45 - Théodore Bedos: I literally said that it is true, it's very legit, I will cook you salmon.
19/10/2023, 10:48 - Théodore Bedos: I have watched your video and the guy is selling probiotics supplements in it. I just find it an interesting topic because first I live the subject and second because I listened to a similar podcast also trying to sell things that I would have liked discussing with someone at the time
19/10/2023, 10:48 - Théodore Bedos: Not trying to make you feel dumb
19/10/2023, 10:49 - Théodore Bedos: Please eat salmon and nuts, please
19/10/2023, 10:49 - Gracou: This guy is really respectable with his promotions so I don’t think it invalidâtes the rest of what he said
19/10/2023, 10:50 - Gracou: It doesn’t make me feel dumb I just feel u wanted to feel smart
19/10/2023, 10:51 - Théodore Bedos: I don't think either. Neither for the guy that I listened in the podcast. He said very legit things as well but I just think it needs to be nuanced because I see it everywhere at the moment. The fact that you heard about it, confirms that it is being quiet hyped up.
19/10/2023, 10:52 - Théodore Bedos: I live the subject, it is hard not to want to talk about everything that I thought about it when you bring it up
19/10/2023, 10:52 - Théodore Bedos: I love*
19/10/2023, 10:53 - Théodore Bedos: Please eat lots of Salmon. I hope you are not frustrated anymore 🙏❤️
19/10/2023, 10:58 - Gracou: i just watehc it bc i was subscribed to the guy, its a slightly older video it wasnt recommended to me x
19/10/2023, 10:58 - Gracou: i know but sometimes it comes accross like you don't want to talk about it you want to monologue about it xx

24/10/2023, 14:23 - Théodore Bedos: Had to wear denim for a charity fundraiser. 
Best outfit win 100£ Amazon card
24/10/2023, 14:23 - Théodore Bedos: 🤞
24/10/2023, 15:17 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/10/2023, 15:18 - Gracou: This is so random 😂
24/10/2023, 15:36 - Théodore Bedos: I miss giving you back cuddles while you work
24/10/2023, 20:47 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
24/10/2023, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: Amazing babe
24/10/2023, 20:50 - Théodore Bedos: I am scared, you are not gonna need me anymore 😭
24/10/2023, 20:50 - Gracou: No babe
24/10/2023, 20:50 - Gracou: The recipe was for four people
24/10/2023, 20:50 - Gracou: So I put four times the amount of lemon into the recipe
24/10/2023, 20:50 - Gracou: 😭😭😭😭
24/10/2023, 20:51 - Gracou: So it looks beautiful but is partially inedible 😂😂😂
24/10/2023, 20:51 - Gracou: I couldn’t finish the broccoli
24/10/2023, 20:51 - Gracou: But other than the issue with the lemon, it was cooked perfectly
24/10/2023, 20:51 - Gracou: I Will retry it tomorrow at lunch since it doesn’t take long to to the salmon and broccoli and the potatoes are cooked
24/10/2023, 20:52 - Gracou: But clearly I still need supervision
24/10/2023, 21:10 - Théodore Bedos: Well done
25/10/2023, 15:29 - Théodore Bedos: https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/86497041#/?channel=RES_BUY
25/10/2023, 15:30 - Théodore Bedos: I found this shite house in the centre of Trowbridge. Not saying you should buy it but I thought you would be curious
25/10/2023, 15:31 - Théodore Bedos: if you rent each of the 3 rooms for 500£, as per your calculation method it would be a 12% return on investment
25/10/2023, 15:39 - Gracou: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
25/10/2023, 15:39 - Gracou: Do you realise what it is?
25/10/2023, 15:40 - Gracou: 😂
25/10/2023, 15:56 - Théodore Bedos: What is it?
25/10/2023, 16:10 - Gracou: It’s a weed growing facility 😂😂
25/10/2023, 16:11 - Théodore Bedos: How do you know that?
25/10/2023, 16:17 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
25/10/2023, 16:18 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
25/10/2023, 16:18 - Gracou: Why else would you grow that amount of plants inside
25/10/2023, 16:38 - Théodore Bedos: Why would they leave it in the picture if it's so obvious?
25/10/2023, 16:39 - Gracou: it is clearly not obvious because you didnt notice
25/10/2023, 16:39 - Théodore Bedos: Does that make it a less good deal?
25/10/2023, 16:39 - Gracou: also at auction they take a picture of the property exactly as is
25/10/2023, 16:39 - Gracou: they dont alter it
25/10/2023, 16:39 - Gracou: it makes me concerned a little
25/10/2023, 16:40 - Gracou: but mainly i think the important thing is that the building will require a lot of money to renovate
25/10/2023, 16:40 - Gracou: so the return wouldnt be 12%
25/10/2023, 16:40 - Gracou: you have to include the renovation costs with the purchase costs in the calculation x
25/10/2023, 17:10 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
25/10/2023, 17:36 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it's mine
25/10/2023, 22:33 - Gracou: Okay
25/10/2023, 22:33 - Gracou: How was your day? Xx
25/10/2023, 22:48 - Théodore Bedos: Not the most efficient day. I went to play golf. I am enjoying my new driver
25/10/2023, 22:48 - Théodore Bedos: And you?
25/10/2023, 22:49 - Gracou: Woo!
25/10/2023, 22:50 - Gracou: I had quite a good day
25/10/2023, 22:51 - Gracou: The Amazon has made £22k in the past month which is r really good! I can’t take all the credit for it tho
25/10/2023, 22:51 - Gracou: I am taking tomorrow off to finish sorting my things
25/10/2023, 22:52 - Gracou: To be honest I really feel like I have screen brain so am going to try to not go on IG I think
25/10/2023, 23:09 - Théodore Bedos: Good job babe
25/10/2023, 23:10 - Théodore Bedos: You can do it
I will try to do the same to support you
25/10/2023, 23:11 - Théodore Bedos: By the way my Uniqlo jean has arrived and it's way to skinny for me. The colour was awfull as well. Sort of off White almost grey, really bad 😩
26/10/2023, 11:21 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/10/2023, 11:24 - Théodore Bedos: I am watching a conference and a mathematician explained that men rates women very evenly. We find as many women beautiful as we found some less attractive. Where as women only found that 1 over 6 men is above average 🤣🤣🤣😂
26/10/2023, 11:24 - Théodore Bedos: Not beautiful, just above average 🤣
26/10/2023, 12:46 - Gracou: Because we are obviously more pretty than men babe
26/10/2023, 12:49 - Théodore Bedos: Or you have unreasonable standards
26/10/2023, 12:50 - Gracou: Maybe
26/10/2023, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: So how did you do with the packing did it go as planned?
26/10/2023, 22:21 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
26/10/2023, 22:21 - Gracou: Im still doing it
26/10/2023, 22:21 - Gracou: null
26/10/2023, 22:38 - Gracou: Have you seen that fury and ngannu are fighting
26/10/2023, 22:57 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I am very hyped
26/10/2023, 22:59 - Théodore Bedos: Fury is so disrespectful that he booked a fight with the world champion in less than 2 months. Meaning he thinks Ngannou is gonna be a sparing partner for him. 
I hope Ngannou will make him regret
27/10/2023, 09:57 - Théodore Bedos: Are you coming next week end? And if yes will you come to the Sunday lunch club (old people lunch). I need to let them know in advance.

29/10/2023, 17:58 - Gracou: What do you want for your birthday babe!
29/10/2023, 17:58 - Gracou: Thanks 😁😁
29/10/2023, 17:58 - Gracou: I don’t think it was the most flattering on me
29/10/2023, 17:58 - Gracou: Thank you baby
29/10/2023, 18:00 - Théodore Bedos: I think I have a problem. Every time I see the photo it annoys me to see that you have blood on your nose. I know it's fake but for 0,5sec I am not feeling good because you seem hurt
29/10/2023, 18:02 - Gracou: It is lipgloss 😁
29/10/2023, 18:03 - Théodore Bedos: I have a list but it's complicate

30/10/2023, 13:04 - Théodore Bedos: I got you approved for the Sunday Lunch club.
30/10/2023, 14:11 - Gracou: Amazing 😁😁
30/10/2023, 16:38 - Gracou: I have had an offer accepted on my third property today! 🥳
30/10/2023, 17:20 - Théodore Bedos: Wow!!!!! Congrats!!

What kind of property is it?
30/10/2023, 17:52 - Gracou: It is a 2 bedroom maisonette 😊
30/10/2023, 17:52 - Gracou: I met the tenants and they are very nice
30/10/2023, 17:56 - Théodore Bedos: Nice
30/10/2023, 17:56 - Théodore Bedos: How much? Where?
30/10/2023, 17:59 - Gracou: 66k x it’s quite central in Warrington
30/10/2023, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: Nice price!!
30/10/2023, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: Is there a lot of work to do?
30/10/2023, 20:58 - Théodore Bedos: It's the second this year, right? That's going fast!
30/10/2023, 23:36 - Gracou: Well there are tenants in it at the moment so we can just leave it as it is 😁😁
30/10/2023, 23:36 - Gracou: Yes it’s quite soon!
30/10/2023, 23:36 - Gracou: I Hope everything goes okay
30/10/2023, 23:38 - Gracou: How was your day?❤️ I missed you today!
31/10/2023, 07:16 - Théodore Bedos: That's really amazing! How much rent are they paying?
31/10/2023, 07:17 - Théodore Bedos: Did you find the property yourself? What was the starting price?
31/10/2023, 07:18 - Théodore Bedos: Normal day, office and then climbing
31/10/2023, 07:18 - Théodore Bedos: I missed you too
31/10/2023, 07:18 - Théodore Bedos: When do you think you'll come Thursday or Friday evening?
31/10/2023, 10:52 - Théodore Bedos: Basically Thursday evening there is a gala diner for my Company and I need to attend. I will be back by midnight. You can arrive Thursday and Callum or Ana will let you in. And I'll arrive after. 
Or you can arrive Friday. I can come pick you up Friday like last time. So let me know. Maybe to make it easy for your mom to pick you up and not have to bring your car you can take the train to Bristol on Monday.
31/10/2023, 11:59 - Théodore Bedos: Saturday there is the placement/grad tournament at uni were placement and grad come and play against/with current players. If we were going in Bath from 10 to 14 and I was doing this on campus. Would you have something to do in town?
I can easily not do it if you don't have anything you would want to do while I do it.
31/10/2023, 16:12 - Théodore Bedos: I would just need an answer quickly about this one please 🙏 x
31/10/2023, 16:16 - Gracou: I Will have a look in 30 mins x
31/10/2023, 16:55 - Gracou: £7200 so it’s a 10% return! (There is £6000 auction fee on top of the £66k so total cost was £72k in the end)
31/10/2023, 16:55 - Gracou: I could get a higher rent but I like the current tenants in there and don’t want to kick them out
31/10/2023, 16:56 - Gracou: Yes I found it my start - in the begining it was in the £80k range but they didn’t get much interest at that price
31/10/2023, 16:58 - Gracou: Friday evening c
31/10/2023, 16:58 - Gracou: Can you pick me up from bath by any chance? Then I can take the train x
31/10/2023, 16:59 - Gracou: My mum said she wouldn’t drive me again it was too out of the way
31/10/2023, 16:59 - Gracou: What are you wearing to the gal?
31/10/2023, 16:59 - Gracou: Gala?
31/10/2023, 16:59 - Gracou: Yeah sure I can probably find something to do - my friend luka is still there
31/10/2023, 17:24 - Théodore Bedos: That's good discount!
31/10/2023, 17:25 - Théodore Bedos: Very kind of you. Also I guess it's nice to not have to find new ones and know that these one won't be trouble
31/10/2023, 17:26 - Gracou: Yes I think they are good people and will look after the house well. It also means I don’t need to worry about renovating or anything and it will just start making money virtually straight away
31/10/2023, 17:26 - Gracou: Yep!
31/10/2023, 17:27 - Théodore Bedos: If you take the train up to bath you may as well just continue to Frome or Trowbridge it's just 20/30min more
31/10/2023, 17:27 - Gracou: But the trains don’t come very often I will be waiting out in the cold :(
31/10/2023, 17:28 - Théodore Bedos: I know that, so that's why I am saying why don't you take the train from Frome to Bristol on Monday so that she can just pick you up in Bristol which is not far of her road
31/10/2023, 17:30 - Théodore Bedos: It does come often for Trowbridge. But really isn't the best that I come and meet you at the petrol station near Bristol like last time so that it's easy for you and no hustle for your parents. And on the way back you take the train from Frome to Bristol and so it's just a small way out for them?
31/10/2023, 17:30 - Théodore Bedos: I have to hire a toxedo 😭😭
31/10/2023, 17:31 - Théodore Bedos: I can expense it though
31/10/2023, 17:32 - Théodore Bedos: Honestly I am equally happy to spend more time with you than doing the volleyball. I am offering because I thought you would enjoy doing charity shopping and seeing friend. If you don't particularly want to do this. I am more than happy to not do volleyball
31/10/2023, 23:18 - Gracou: They won’t do it
31/10/2023, 23:19 - Gracou: It is a hassle for my parents it caused huge arguments last time.
31/10/2023, 23:19 - Gracou: I don’t rlly appreciate you asking for my parents to solve the problem
31/10/2023, 23:20 - Gracou: Yeah I’m happy to see my friend and do charity shopping
31/10/2023, 23:26 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
31/10/2023, 23:28 - Théodore Bedos: To make it simple for you???? 🤨
Is that difficult to imagine?
31/10/2023, 23:30 - Théodore Bedos: How exactly am I asking them to solve any problems. I am offering to pick you up exactly on their way between Devon and Manchester.
31/10/2023, 23:31 - Gracou: It seemed like it was more for you as it isn’t more simple with me
31/10/2023, 23:31 - Gracou: For me*
31/10/2023, 23:32 - Gracou: I told you last time that it caused issues
31/10/2023, 23:33 - Théodore Bedos: It is not nicer for you to drive down with your parents and meet me at the petrol station than having to pay 100£ and do 6h of train??
31/10/2023, 23:33 - Gracou: THEY WONT DRIVE ME THEO
31/10/2023, 23:33 - Gracou: how many times do I have to say that.
31/10/2023, 23:35 - Gracou: My mums suggestion was for me to go all the way down to Devon and get the train from fricking devon
31/10/2023, 23:35 - Gracou: So yes the 6h train sounds better than driving 5 hours home then getting on a 3/4 hr train to Frome
31/10/2023, 23:36 - Gracou: I need to go to sleep now.
31/10/2023, 23:36 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
31/10/2023, 23:37 - Gracou: ITS A PROBLEM BECAUSE I TOLD YOU SO!
31/10/2023, 23:38 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
31/10/2023, 23:38 - Gracou: Can you just type please?
31/10/2023, 23:38 - Gracou: My parents are asleep and I can’t play noises out on my phone
31/10/2023, 23:39 - Gracou: THEO
31/10/2023, 23:39 - Gracou: Im getting annoyed because you’re not listening to me
31/10/2023, 23:39 - Gracou: Just take what I’ve said on board rather than constantly arguing the logic about it
31/10/2023, 23:40 - Gracou: Just accept it
31/10/2023, 23:40 - Gracou: It’s so unsupportive
31/10/2023, 23:40 - Gracou: I really need to sleep
31/10/2023, 23:41 - Gracou: I haven’t even booked anything anyway I’m just asking whether you would pick me up
31/10/2023, 23:41 - Théodore Bedos: I AM LISTENING GRACE. 

If you want me to pick you up in bath I will do it I don't care. 

But it shouldn't be a problem just to want to understand the situation
31/10/2023, 23:41 - Gracou: I don’t need to go through a whole discussion with you over why my parents don’t want me in the fucking car
31/10/2023, 23:41 - Gracou: It’s just bc they don’t want the stress of having to deal with it
31/10/2023, 23:42 - Gracou: If it turns out the train is a stupid idea I won’t do it
31/10/2023, 23:42 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight
31/10/2023, 23:42 - Gracou: But it’s not helpful to have to have you picking apart everything and for me to have to say over and over that my parents don’t want to
31/10/2023, 23:43 - Gracou: Why couldn’t you have just said of course you would pick me up in the first place then?
31/10/2023, 23:43 - Gracou: And then maybe after that it would have made sense to say that you didn’t think it was the quickest option
31/10/2023, 23:44 - Gracou: Instead I just end up thinking you can’t be bothered and then that you won’t accept what I’m asking you to do and won’t listen to why I can’t do the thing you’re suggesting
31/10/2023, 23:45 - Gracou: Im sorry for swearing
31/10/2023, 23:45 - Théodore Bedos: Because of course I will pick you no matter what if you ask me. That's a dumb question. Even if you ask me to pick you up from London I would do. 

But honestly picking you up in Bath is just the worst option. So yes I am trying to understand why
31/10/2023, 23:46 - Gracou: No it isn’t a dumb question
31/10/2023, 23:46 - Théodore Bedos: It is
31/10/2023, 23:46 - Gracou: Firstly bc I don’t think I’m entitled for you to do things for me
31/10/2023, 23:46 - Théodore Bedos: You are
31/10/2023, 23:46 - Gracou: Secondly bc if that was the case you might have gone to Devon for me this weekend
31/10/2023, 23:47 - Gracou: And frankly even if I ask a dumb question I still deserve a proper answer
31/10/2023, 23:47 - Théodore Bedos: I can't because I have to do the Sunday lunch club. Otherwise I wouldn't mind if you wanted to
31/10/2023, 23:49 - Théodore Bedos: I deserve a proper answer too. I deserve to have an explanation about why I Bath. Rather than just a shut up and accept it
31/10/2023, 23:50 - Gracou: Why can’t you just accept that I have a good reason? It’s not nice to have to explain myself all the time
31/10/2023, 23:50 - Théodore Bedos: Because frankly Bath is the worst option, maybe not for you, but for me for sure
31/10/2023, 23:51 - Théodore Bedos: And because I am not a dog. I don't receive orders without having a context
31/10/2023, 23:51 - Gracou: Im not giving an order? I’m just asking a question
31/10/2023, 23:52 - Gracou: Im going to bed. Unfortunately now I don’t think I will sleep very well.
31/10/2023, 23:52 - Théodore Bedos: Do you think you are the only one who would have want to go to bed earlier?
31/10/2023, 23:58 - Théodore Bedos: I just want to understand because I won't be able to sleep.

If your mum is willing to drive you all the way to Devon for you to take a train from there. Then the problem is not that you are in the car. So why can't she not just drop you at the petrol station, that is directly on her itinerary already?
 It's cheaper for you, it's faster for you, it is not longer for her and it allow me to get my special fuel.
31/10/2023, 23:58 - Théodore Bedos: Please

07/11/2023, 15:49 - Théodore Bedos: You go on the control panel, you then click on the up arrow until it goes to 20 and then you press done. If it worked there is a little heating sign next to the temperature displayed. Also the radiator in the room should start feeling warm

07/11/2023, 23:33 - Gracou: She told me it was my fault for not answering my phone quick enough and said that I just always have a problem with everyone etc
07/11/2023, 23:33 - Gracou: And I got home and told my parents and they were just telling me I’m unorganised etc
07/11/2023, 23:34 - Gracou: And they said about this holiday we are going on and my dad said he was going to speak to my sister and I to make sure we know to behave
07/11/2023, 23:35 - Gracou: And I said I understand that and I will do my bit but sometimes i feel like I’m just expected to take Darcy’s mean comments which we all know she makes and nothing gets done
07/11/2023, 23:36 - Gracou: And they were just lecturing me and saying I was ungrateful etc
07/11/2023, 23:37 - Théodore Bedos: I see well that's annoying
07/11/2023, 23:38 - Théodore Bedos: Karma will turn back on her
08/11/2023, 09:57 - Gracou: 🤷‍♀️
08/11/2023, 09:59 - Théodore Bedos: I got two offers for the appartement in London at 1700!! (Also lots of one at 1600). It's crazy we were renting for 1300 in February

09/11/2023, 13:21 - Gracou: I’ve been told it’s today in the uk so maybe your source is wrong 😳
09/11/2023, 13:23 - Théodore Bedos: Find a source that says that it is today and I will celebrate it. 

Because you can't have the 21st of August, the 9th of Nov and the 16th of Nov. 

That's unfair

13/11/2023, 10:42 - Gracou: It’s very disrespectful to come to my place of work and say that
13/11/2023, 15:58 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to wait by the appartement now so that we can have a proper goodbye. I need to practice some stuff at loud anyway so I'll do that in my car
13/11/2023, 16:34 - Théodore Bedos: I am buy the appartement

13/11/2023, 16:49 - Théodore Bedos: 😢
13/11/2023, 16:50 - Gracou: Im wasn’t planning to go straight to the apartment after work anyway I need to go to sainsburies
13/11/2023, 16:50 - Gracou: Can you meet me at sainsburys
13/11/2023, 16:50 - Gracou: I can’t really leave work until 5 now otherwise it looks bad
13/11/2023, 16:51 - Théodore Bedos: I thought you were not gonna come back because you packed all your stuffs
13/11/2023, 16:51 - Théodore Bedos: I am probably gonna leave now

13/11/2023, 21:20 - Théodore Bedos: No problems on the road, I took less than 3h40 with the stop for fuel.
13/11/2023, 21:48 - Gracou: 🎉🎉🎉
13/11/2023, 23:14 - Théodore Bedos: I found 2 other songs from the guy that did Summer flow 88. It's "good morning" and "relax". I like them a lot too
13/11/2023, 23:17 - Théodore Bedos: Good morning is especially nice for me because it talks about how he wishes his girls to tell him "good morning" in english every day. So it feels like you for me
13/11/2023, 23:35 - Théodore Bedos: Love you lots😘 goodnight
13/11/2023, 23:37 - Gracou: <Médias omis>

14/11/2023, 11:06 - Théodore Bedos: Very nice! Once the protein powder pot behind is empty you could maybe use it instead
14/11/2023, 11:06 - Gracou: Yes very classy 😁
14/11/2023, 11:06 - Théodore Bedos: I would think so because the song is in french but when he says "good morning" it's in English.
14/11/2023, 16:27 - Gracou: pretty pretty please can you send me the links to your gifts xoxo

14/11/2023, 19:24 - Gracou: Okay xo
14/11/2023, 19:24 - Gracou: Thanks for sending the gifts
14/11/2023, 19:24 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
14/11/2023, 21:44 - Gracou: Babe it isn’t your fault but my dad just arrived at home and shouted at me for being an hour late to see you on Friday
14/11/2023, 21:45 - Gracou: Please can you not mention things like that in the future - I wouldn’t mention it to your parents if it was the other way around x
14/11/2023, 21:53 - Gracou: Also I found your necklace!
14/11/2023, 22:34 - Théodore Bedos: Do you mean when I arrived Friday evening and you where not there? Why is he shouting at you now about this?!?
14/11/2023, 22:37 - Théodore Bedos: I did not think he would use it against you, I thought we were only joking about it when it was mentioned at dinner.
14/11/2023, 22:40 - Théodore Bedos: You know that when your dad ask me in front of your family if you can't wake up or if you are unorganised, I take your defense. I only mention stuff that you did wrong when I think we are only joking about it. I did not think he would use it like that.
14/11/2023, 22:42 - Théodore Bedos: I will be more careful next time
14/11/2023, 22:56 - Gracou: No he said that it infuriated and embarassed him that I acted that way but he didn’t want to embarrass me in front of you
14/11/2023, 22:57 - Gracou: I understand I think I just need to stop really telling my dad things about my life bc he just starts trying to micromanage me
14/11/2023, 22:57 - Gracou: Thank you I appreciate it
14/11/2023, 23:42 - Théodore Bedos: I was pretty upset when it happened, I don't think it was nice and it took me some self control to be nice about it at first. But I thought you were honestly sorry about it and apologized to me nicely. So I don't think it requires more about it. It's between us anyway he shouldn't be taking it like if it was affecting him.
14/11/2023, 23:43 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe, that's probably not a bad idea. There are already quite a lot he will know without you having to tell anything just because of you having to live so close.
14/11/2023, 23:57 - Gracou: I agrée
14/11/2023, 23:57 - Gracou: Have your parents decided whether they are coming for xmas?

15/11/2023, 14:46 - Théodore Bedos: Some other option for raw and white denim that are available in the UK.
15/11/2023, 14:47 - Théodore Bedos: I am a size 3 in orslow and size 32 in wax london.
15/11/2023, 14:47 - Théodore Bedos: Also, I have no problems with you grouping my birthday and Christmas together as the things I listed are quite expensive
15/11/2023, 16:51 - Théodore Bedos: I am wearing the shirt from the charity shop today. I am very pleased with it. It stayed very well in my trouser all day, is well fitted and did not feel restricting.
15/11/2023, 21:46 - Théodore Bedos: Omg I am so called tonight, like if I was very sick. But I just came back from a big gym training so I don't know how I can be sick if I had energy to train like that. Maybe I trained too hard? I am chivering in bed right now
15/11/2023, 21:46 - Théodore Bedos: Cold*
15/11/2023, 21:47 - Gracou: Oooo did you take a picture?

15/11/2023, 21:47 - Théodore Bedos: I just did
15/11/2023, 21:47 - Gracou: Oh dear
15/11/2023, 21:47 - Théodore Bedos: Not yet because I am too weak to be bothered
15/11/2023, 21:47 - Gracou: null
15/11/2023, 22:22 - Gracou: Going to cry I was just about to but your gift but they won’t deliver to uk 😭
15/11/2023, 22:27 - Gracou: I want you to have something that you want though - can I group your gifts but have you open ur big gift at christmas? I don’t want you to be sat around all day on xmas and have nothing to open from me
15/11/2023, 22:34 - Gracou: I like how silly this improve dance is https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeJe2eCU/
16/11/2023, 07:09 - Théodore Bedos: Very good
16/11/2023, 09:17 - Théodore Bedos: Yes sure no problems. Especially if it's a french thing it will be cheaper if you buy it in France.
16/11/2023, 09:23 - Théodore Bedos: Also I forgot to add to the list but you can also offer me tomes of berserks (tome 28 and above) and kingdom tome (16 and above). You can find the french edition on Amazon if you type "tome" like "kingdom tome 16". 
There is also 20century boys that I would like to start. Their are only 12 tomes but they are big and more expensive than normal manga. I don't think they are on Amazon in french. You can find them in french on la Fnac and ship them oversea for 5£.
16/11/2023, 09:34 - Gracou: Tomes?
16/11/2023, 09:35 - Théodore Bedos: Tome means volume in french
16/11/2023, 09:36 - Théodore Bedos: If you type tome instead of volume in Amazon you will find the french editions

Heat them in a pan with oil until they are golden and that's it.
17/11/2023, 10:43 - Théodore Bedos: They are in the same section than pizza, fresh pasta and soups in my Lidl
17/11/2023, 10:44 - Gracou: Oooooo I’m so excited

18/11/2023, 16:31 - Théodore Bedos: Because of everything I told you last time. They couldn't find an hotel in Frome, they are a bit short in budget at the moment, I was not ecstatic about them coming, etc, etc

22/11/2023, 16:01 - Théodore Bedos: I saved my luggage
22/11/2023, 22:44 - Théodore Bedos: What's going on with that new year party thing. I open the group chat it says it's gonna cost 60£!!!
22/11/2023, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: And why is it 4 days long (3 nights)!
23/11/2023, 00:43 - Gracou: Jt sounds like you enjoyed x
23/11/2023, 00:43 - Gracou: Yes we are staying at an Airbnb like I told you - £60 for three nights is very cheap
23/11/2023, 00:43 - Gracou: It’s a weekend trip
23/11/2023, 00:44 - Gracou: And it was basically the same cost for 3 nights as it was for 2
23/11/2023, 08:37 - Théodore Bedos: Is it really such a good deal? 300£ per night is just the price of airbnbs in Frome
23/11/2023, 08:38 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
23/11/2023, 08:40 - Théodore Bedos: You never told me about a week end trip. You just asked me if I was ok with  going to a party instead of doing new year eve together
23/11/2023, 08:51 - Théodore Bedos: I feel tricked
23/11/2023, 08:52 - Théodore Bedos: And I don't want to pay 60£ for going to Frome. I already live in Frome.
23/11/2023, 09:13 - Gracou: Thats not true
23/11/2023, 09:13 - Gracou: Im really disapointed by this
23/11/2023, 09:14 - Gracou: I did explain and frankly theo you have been in that groupchat for ages you just couldn’t be bothered to look
23/11/2023, 09:15 - Gracou: Theo the point isn’t about it being in Frome it’s about it being a trip with friends and the fact that you don’t want to do it is so hurtful and disappointing
23/11/2023, 09:22 - Théodore Bedos: That is so unfair. You never told it was gonna be 4 days!!!  You just asked me if I was fine going to a party with your friend.
23/11/2023, 09:26 - Théodore Bedos: Joe, Lolly and Abbie are thinking the same, that it's too expensive and it doesn't make sense. They just don't want to say it explicitly.
23/11/2023, 09:28 - Gracou: That’s not true
23/11/2023, 09:29 - Gracou: Joe and lolly are saying they don’t want to pay more than 60
23/11/2023, 09:29 - Gracou: Bc Abbie is trying to pay less than 60 which would mean the rest of us pay more
23/11/2023, 09:29 - Théodore Bedos: You only have 12 people answering your pole. That's 75 per persons
23/11/2023, 09:30 - Gracou: not everyone has answered the poll
23/11/2023, 09:30 - Gracou: I Will just remove you from the group chat if that’s what you prefer
23/11/2023, 09:31 - Théodore Bedos: You are just 8 who have said that want to go more than one evening. So probably not just Abbie and I think that they don't want to pay 60.
23/11/2023, 09:32 - Gracou: You’re attitude is literally so awful
23/11/2023, 09:33 - Gracou: There were so many other ways you could have gone about this conversation
23/11/2023, 09:34 - Gracou: And the way you have gone about it just reminds me again that you don’t give a shit about my feelings about you being someone I can have in a group and with my friends and how important that is to me
23/11/2023, 09:34 - Théodore Bedos: What? You are the one which attitude is awful. You've bullshited me about this so that I agree with it. And now you are making me feel bad for saying that I have never agreed with a 4days trip.
23/11/2023, 09:34 - Théodore Bedos: That's really not cool.
23/11/2023, 09:35 - Théodore Bedos: I was happy to go do new year's eve with your friend. You had no need to lie to me about all of this
23/11/2023, 09:35 - Gracou: I told you what we were planning
23/11/2023, 09:35 - Théodore Bedos: No!!
23/11/2023, 09:35 - Gracou: And even if you feel I didn’t you’ve been in the group chat the whole time but you didn’t bother checking because it isn’t important to you
23/11/2023, 09:35 - Gracou: I haven’t lied about anything!
23/11/2023, 09:36 - Théodore Bedos: I did check it, the last time I checked it was about Sam and Chris half marathon.
23/11/2023, 09:36 - Théodore Bedos: Why would I be checking the group chat of a Party????
23/11/2023, 09:37 - Théodore Bedos: I have better things to do
23/11/2023, 09:37 - Théodore Bedos: Unless I know it's a trip and not a party! But guess what no one told me it was gonna be a 4 DAY TRIP!
23/11/2023, 09:40 - Théodore Bedos: I am not happy with you lying to me like this
23/11/2023, 10:18 - Gracou: That really sums it up
23/11/2023, 10:18 - Gracou: How dare you call me a liar
23/11/2023, 10:19 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I have better things to do than checking 5 times a day a WhatsApp conversation. How is that wrong? I don't receive notifications as for every group chat that I am on
23/11/2023, 10:20 - Théodore Bedos: I am not calling you a liar, I said you lied to me.
23/11/2023, 10:25 - Théodore Bedos: You never told me it was gonna be 4 nights and you never told me it would cost 60£.
23/11/2023, 10:25 - Gracou: It isn’t four nights for starters
23/11/2023, 10:26 - Gracou: And I don’t agree with you I think u just weren’t listening to me
23/11/2023, 10:26 - Théodore Bedos: I feel like you are forcing me to pay for your friends reunion.
23/11/2023, 10:26 - Gracou: Okay don’t come then?
23/11/2023, 10:26 - Théodore Bedos: No Grace, no!! Stop that. You never told me this
23/11/2023, 10:26 - Gracou: Did I complain about paying for your volleyball friends reuinion in Portugal?
23/11/2023, 10:27 - Gracou: Did you complain about Disney that was expensive? No but that’s bc it didn’t involve you having to spend time with my friends
23/11/2023, 10:30 - Théodore Bedos: Why are you being like that. It's exactly why I am upset.

It is nothing like Portugal. In Portugal no one who have paid more if you didn't want to come. Here you are forcing me about to pay 60£ because if I don't every one will pay more.
And yes I complained about Disney, I made lots of remarks about the price. This has nothing to do with your friends. 

This has to do with you telling me it was going to be a one night party thing, and turning into 4 days and 60£
23/11/2023, 10:30 - Théodore Bedos: *No one would have had to pay more
23/11/2023, 10:34 - Théodore Bedos: Also Disney, I organised it for you, I decided to pay that money. It's a completely different feeling than feeling forced into a situation because someone has mot been honest with you.
23/11/2023, 10:35 - Théodore Bedos: I would have probably be ok with this trip if you had been honest with me from the beginning. I don't get why you had to manipulate me like this
23/11/2023, 11:23 - Gracou: THEO WHAT THE FUCK
23/11/2023, 11:23 - Gracou: It is not your place at all to say what you said on the group chat
23/11/2023, 11:23 - Gracou: Im really annoyed with you
23/11/2023, 11:24 - Théodore Bedos: Why?
23/11/2023, 11:25 - Gracou: You’re going as my guest they aren’t your friends it isn’t your trip and your trying to interfere
23/11/2023, 11:25 - Gracou: And your contradicting what people were saying
23/11/2023, 11:26 - Gracou: And you’re saying that without even committing to say what amount of days you will go
23/11/2023, 11:26 - Gracou: So ur basically just screwing people over who want to stay for three days
23/11/2023, 11:26 - Gracou: I can’t believe this
23/11/2023, 11:28 - Théodore Bedos: I did, I said the 31st
23/11/2023, 11:28 - Gracou: I would prefer you didn’t come than just come for one night that is such an insult to me.
23/11/2023, 11:28 - Théodore Bedos: This is a joke seriously, you were reproaching me to not get involved and now you are upset for saying what I think
23/11/2023, 11:29 - Théodore Bedos: No!!! They would pay 80 as for people staying 2 days
23/11/2023, 11:30 - Théodore Bedos: They would not be paying any extra
23/11/2023, 11:31 - Théodore Bedos: 60 for everyone is just so unfair. You are making people pay for your holidays. Sam said that if it was like I proposed then people would just come 1 night. Well then if that's the case then why do you force people to come 2 nights????
23/11/2023, 11:32 - Théodore Bedos: 80 for a 3 days trip is a nice price and 30 for one night as well. But 60 for one night is hit and you are basically just paying for the other to enjoy a cheap Holland
23/11/2023, 11:32 - Théodore Bedos: Holiday
23/11/2023, 11:33 - Gracou: It isn’t appropriate for you to make that suggestion at all
23/11/2023, 11:33 - Gracou: And it’s a dick move to say you will only go for one night
23/11/2023, 11:33 - Théodore Bedos: Why is it an insult? You asked me to come one nigh
23/11/2023, 11:34 - Gracou: I don’t want you to come anymore and I don’t want to speak to you.
23/11/2023, 11:34 - Gracou: I need some space
23/11/2023, 11:34 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf, so I have to pay 60 but I am not awarded the right to speak. Wtf!!!!
24/11/2023, 08:07 - Théodore Bedos: I am still positive by the way
24/11/2023, 19:11 - Gracou: Im sorry to hear that.
24/11/2023, 19:42 - Théodore Bedos: If I test negative tomorrow morning, will you come?
24/11/2023, 22:28 - Théodore Bedos: I miss you
24/11/2023, 22:32 - Gracou: Yes I would come
24/11/2023, 22:35 - Théodore Bedos: Please please please may I be negative tomorrow 🙏🙏🙏🙏
25/11/2023, 08:22 - Théodore Bedos: I am negative!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

25/11/2023, 09:13 - Théodore Bedos: I am positive actually
25/11/2023, 09:13 - Théodore Bedos: There is a small bar that appeared after a while
25/11/2023, 09:13 - Théodore Bedos: I want to cry
25/11/2023, 10:17 - Théodore Bedos: Are you still sleeping? I am worried you took the road but did not see my message
25/11/2023, 10:29 - Gracou: I was still sleeping
25/11/2023, 10:29 - Gracou: This is really unlucky
25/11/2023, 10:30 - Gracou: How long did it take for the second bar
25/11/2023, 10:30 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know
25/11/2023, 10:31 - Théodore Bedos: I saw the first bar after 5min when normally the second one would have already appeared. Then I went to watch a movie for 30min and when I check again it was like that
25/11/2023, 10:31 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
25/11/2023, 10:32 - Gracou: You have to wait 20 mins to find out your test result
25/11/2023, 10:32 - Gracou: Do another one and wait 20 mins before reading it
25/11/2023, 10:53 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
25/11/2023, 10:54 - Théodore Bedos: That's after 15min, but says to wait between 15b and 30
25/11/2023, 10:54 - Gracou: Oh
25/11/2023, 10:54 - Gracou: Okay then do as the instructions say
25/11/2023, 10:54 - Théodore Bedos: Are you in Devon or in Warrington?
25/11/2023, 10:54 - Gracou: Warrington
25/11/2023, 11:07 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
25/11/2023, 11:07 - Théodore Bedos: 30min
25/11/2023, 11:07 - Théodore Bedos: I won't be upset if you decide not to come
25/11/2023, 11:08 - Gracou: That’s not true
25/11/2023, 11:08 - Théodore Bedos: I promise you
25/11/2023, 11:08 - Théodore Bedos: I will be sad but I won't be upset at you.
25/11/2023, 11:10 - Théodore Bedos: It's already late and there is still a risk. So if you want to just come next weekend, I'll understand. I love you
25/11/2023, 11:11 - Gracou: Tom is leaving for his ski season next Sunday and has been asking if I will visit him in Devon on the Saturday
25/11/2023, 11:12 - Gracou: My mum is in Devon and has just tested positive for covid
25/11/2023, 11:13 - Théodore Bedos: Is she feeling ok?
25/11/2023, 11:13 - Gracou: It’s all not really ideal
25/11/2023, 11:13 - Gracou: I haven’t spoken to her much about it I think she is fine
25/11/2023, 11:14 - Théodore Bedos: So what are you doing?
25/11/2023, 11:14 - Gracou: Im deciding
25/11/2023, 11:19 - Gracou: Would u be willing to go to Devon and stay in the annexe potentially next weekend? It’s further for me but then I might be able to say bye to Tom while u go play golf with my dad or something?
25/11/2023, 11:21 - Théodore Bedos: No sorry
25/11/2023, 11:21 - Gracou: Why?
25/11/2023, 11:23 - Théodore Bedos: Because I would like to spend a week end just with you for my birthday either this week end or next weekend. That's what I have been waiting for the most.
25/11/2023, 11:23 - Théodore Bedos: Also next week end is the Frome/Christmas market and I would prefer not miss it.
25/11/2023, 11:24 - Gracou: Im currently annoyed with you and if it wasn’t your birthday I don’t think I would come
25/11/2023, 11:24 - Gracou: Just so you know I’m busy on the 8/9/10
25/11/2023, 11:25 - Gracou: I only really have today to return the shirts that we bought last time so I wouldn’t be able to come until late this evening or tomorrow I think
25/11/2023, 11:26 - Gracou: So you would prefer basically 1 day with me in Frome to a weekend in Devon?
25/11/2023, 11:31 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know what to say, what you are saying is making me feel really sad
25/11/2023, 11:36 - Théodore Bedos: null
25/11/2023, 13:28 - Gracou: Ah Im stressed
25/11/2023, 13:32 - Théodore Bedos: What's happening?

25/11/2023, 13:33 - Théodore Bedos: Alright
25/11/2023, 13:33 - Théodore Bedos: Do you want me to plan dinner for tonight or do you have a plan?
25/11/2023, 13:33 - Gracou: I don’t have a plan
25/11/2023, 13:33 - Gracou: I Will probably arrive late x
25/11/2023, 13:33 - Théodore Bedos: Ok I will sort out something

01/12/2023, 15:30 - Gracou: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeReyDTF/
01/12/2023, 20:19 - Théodore Bedos: I know your dad told you to be back before 11:30 but if you are having a great time with Tom and you want to stay longer, I will come get you later and I won't tell your parents.
01/12/2023, 20:20 - Théodore Bedos: Just let me know if you decide to stay longer

04/12/2023, 10:12 - Gracou: its a bit annoying after having you around for so much longer than normal that i got used to having you around and now it is much more annoying that you arent here
04/12/2023, 10:12 - Gracou: good luck with your innovation sprint today!

05/12/2023, 10:55 - Gracou: For work?
05/12/2023, 11:26 - Théodore Bedos: No I like to visit hospital for fun
05/12/2023, 20:11 - Gracou: It’s a legitimate question theo
05/12/2023, 20:13 - Théodore Bedos: I am just making fun, I don't want you to take it badly
05/12/2023, 20:14 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I am going for work
05/12/2023, 20:14 - Théodore Bedos: That's unlucky that I am here in Thursday and you come Friday
05/12/2023, 20:15 - Gracou: I know

06/12/2023, 00:45 - Gracou: Good night my love x
06/12/2023, 08:35 - Théodore Bedos: Good morning beautiful ❤️

06/12/2023, 22:01 - Théodore Bedos: https://dusk.com/products/ascot-ottoman-bed-frame-natural?variant=44396304498985
06/12/2023, 22:01 - Théodore Bedos: Dusk ascot ottoman king size
06/12/2023, 22:03 - Théodore Bedos: The head of mine is larger than the mattress so it leaves space between the wall and the bed for a plug. But if you want the bed to be right against the wall to avoid having things falling in between, then the Hampton is nice too

06/12/2023, 23:49 - Gracou: Aww ❤️
06/12/2023, 23:49 - Gracou: Babe you know the cream for the thingy - did u apply it twice a day?
07/12/2023, 09:38 - Théodore Bedos: No just once, and every 3 days
07/12/2023, 09:39 - Théodore Bedos: But I had 2, once from France and one from England and they had different instructions. So I don't know what you should do with yours
07/12/2023, 10:32 - Gracou: I see
07/12/2023, 10:32 - Gracou: She said once but online people say twice so I just thought I would check
07/12/2023, 10:32 - Gracou: I Will do what she says
07/12/2023, 10:50 - Théodore Bedos: Is there no booklet of instructions with it?
07/12/2023, 10:50 - Théodore Bedos: If not I would stick with what she said
07/12/2023, 11:59 - Gracou: I will 👍
07/12/2023, 23:01 - Théodore Bedos: Vous avez supprimé ce message
07/12/2023, 23:02 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight love of my life ❤️
07/12/2023, 23:47 - Gracou: This is the standard in case you were wondering https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGe8AhGpf/
08/12/2023, 10:22 - Gracou: Good morning darling xx
09/12/2023, 08:04 - Théodore Bedos: For your grandfather, I thought I could offer him an arsenal scarf. Which one do you think is the best? And do you think it's a good idea.
09/12/2023, 08:04 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
09/12/2023, 08:04 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
09/12/2023, 08:05 - Théodore Bedos: This one is more fun and Christmassy but it's also quiet thick and so I don't think it's very practical to wear at all.
09/12/2023, 08:05 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
09/12/2023, 08:07 - Théodore Bedos: This one is more sober and it seems like it's soft and so he could actually wear it if he wanted to.
09/12/2023, 08:07 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
09/12/2023, 08:08 - Théodore Bedos: Or a mug, it takes less space but I find it less fun.
09/12/2023, 10:19 - Théodore Bedos: For your dad I am hesitating between a pack of 3 golf socks from Adidas or some sport bands like these one. When I did the little gym program for him, he seemed quiet interested in my band because he can easily carry them between Devon and Warrington to do his gym routine in the morning
09/12/2023, 10:19 - Théodore Bedos: But because he hasn't done the routine much I wonder if it's any use. Maybe that would motivate him?
09/12/2023, 10:20 - Théodore Bedos: For sure that's something he doesn't have. Whereas the golf socks he probably have a lot already
09/12/2023, 12:15 - Théodore Bedos: null
09/12/2023, 12:16 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I need you to give me your opinion quickly because I need to order asap if I want to get these before we fly to Paris
09/12/2023, 15:02 - Théodore Bedos: null
09/12/2023, 15:22 - Gracou: null
09/12/2023, 15:22 - Gracou: I went to bed at 5 so haven’t been up for long 👍 I will have a look
09/12/2023, 15:22 - Gracou: Just have them sent to my house babe
09/12/2023, 15:39 - Gracou: Hmm I suppose this one for the same reasons you have said
09/12/2023, 15:39 - Gracou: I would just get the socks xx
09/12/2023, 15:46 - Théodore Bedos: Are you sure?
09/12/2023, 15:46 - Théodore Bedos: Do you think he will like it?
09/12/2023, 15:46 - Théodore Bedos: Do I need to make a gift to Darcy?
09/12/2023, 17:56 - Gracou: It is up to you but I think it would be nice
09/12/2023, 17:56 - Gracou: I think it’s a good idea he is very difficult to get a gift for
09/12/2023, 17:57 - Gracou: Im not sure if he has one already but I wouldn’t stress about it
09/12/2023, 17:59 - Théodore Bedos: Roger or Alistair ?
09/12/2023, 17:59 - Théodore Bedos: What are your suggestions for Darcy?
09/12/2023, 20:44 - Théodore Bedos: Can you remind me what's the smell I need to pick for your aunty and nanny's candle ?
09/12/2023, 20:46 - Théodore Bedos: Also I was planning to get them from to max but at Lidl they do these delux candle for the same price but they are twice the size as tkmax ones. What do you think I should do? The Lidl one seem better value and more but even though it doesn't say Lidl on it if they found out it's from Lidl it seems a bit cheap from me, isn't it?
09/12/2023, 21:41 - Théodore Bedos: Did I just imagine it or did someone actually said that the new year eve weekend was in Frome? Because Chris just sent the address and it's really not in Frome
09/12/2023, 23:58 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
09/12/2023, 23:58 - Théodore Bedos: By the way I am a bit annoyed because she lied, it is not a snug fit at all.
09/12/2023, 23:59 - Théodore Bedos: It fits but it comes off very easily. I had high hopes for this
10/12/2023, 00:20 - Gracou: Roger - my dad doesn’t support arsenal
10/12/2023, 00:20 - Gracou: Citrus
10/12/2023, 00:21 - Gracou: Hmm maybe a cheap top from a brand called cider under £10
10/12/2023, 00:21 - Gracou: It’s more the thought that counts so don’t worry about that x
10/12/2023, 00:22 - Gracou: It’s just nearer to Frome than bath so we say Frome that was my understanding
10/12/2023, 00:22 - Gracou: You did the thing!
10/12/2023, 00:22 - Gracou: That’s a shame maybe it’s different in America
10/12/2023, 12:58 - Théodore Bedos: I know but you usually say that it is your dad for who it is very difficult to find gift so I was confused.
10/12/2023, 12:58 - Théodore Bedos: And for your nan?
10/12/2023, 12:59 - Théodore Bedos: Ok I'll check, otherwise does she like fun socks as you do?
10/12/2023, 13:00 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, but if you had to choose? Big delux Lidl one or  normal sized one but from tkmax?
10/12/2023, 13:02 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
10/12/2023, 13:02 - Théodore Bedos: This makes me happy when I look at it before going to bed.
10/12/2023, 14:27 - Gracou: They are both hard x
10/12/2023, 14:27 - Gracou: Maybe cedarwood? Pomegranate? She isn’t as picky x
10/12/2023, 14:27 - Gracou: No she doesn’t :/
10/12/2023, 14:27 - Gracou: She just likes very British looking crop tops I think 😂
10/12/2023, 14:28 - Gracou: Maybe tkmax?
10/12/2023, 14:28 - Gracou: Im really glad - I wasn’t sure you were that impressed with it when you first opened it
10/12/2023, 14:36 - Théodore Bedos: Because I am not use to having these sort of things I didn't know I would like it. But now I do. With my basket and your plant I have a little corner of my room that remind me of you and that I see just before going to bed. So I am very happy
10/12/2023, 14:43 - Théodore Bedos: Like these?
10/12/2023, 14:43 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
10/12/2023, 14:43 - Théodore Bedos: 5£ on vinted
10/12/2023, 14:43 - Théodore Bedos: Or is it weird to offer her that?
10/12/2023, 15:20 - Gracou: I think it’s good although the white one looks a bit see through
10/12/2023, 15:21 - Gracou: Im really glad - girlfriend knows best
10/12/2023, 15:22 - Théodore Bedos: So is no good?
10/12/2023, 15:22 - Théodore Bedos: Is this *

11/12/2023, 08:55 - Théodore Bedos: I miss you too. Will be together soon ❤️
11/12/2023, 08:56 - Théodore Bedos: It really hurts me to buy something like that
11/12/2023, 16:25 - Gracou: £40
11/12/2023, 16:25 - Gracou: It’s just my opinion 🤷‍♀️
11/12/2023, 17:08 - Théodore Bedos: Wow that's big gifts! Alright, I'll have a thought about it tonight
11/12/2023, 17:08 - Théodore Bedos: And I appreciate it
11/12/2023, 19:20 - Théodore Bedos: Would Darcy like these?
11/12/2023, 19:20 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
11/12/2023, 19:23 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe that's weird if I offer her jewellery. Thanks. A boyfriend thing to do. Not a brother in law
11/12/2023, 20:04 - Gracou: Yes that would work
11/12/2023, 20:04 - Gracou: She has a thing for silver did they have those in silver I think she would like them
11/12/2023, 23:02 - Théodore Bedos: It's unlucky you answered just when I left
11/12/2023, 23:02 - Théodore Bedos: I did not get them, I wasn't sure and I thought she like silver too
11/12/2023, 23:03 - Théodore Bedos: They had some in silver but they looked a bit cheap
11/12/2023, 23:03 - Théodore Bedos: If you didn't know it was silver you would think it was plastic
11/12/2023, 23:18 - Gracou: Oh dear
12/12/2023, 00:43 - Théodore Bedos: I made you a list of ideas for budgets from 8 to 42 pounds.

12/12/2023, 00:47 - Gracou: Hi Grace
We are not having to pick Darcy up so we can drive you to Asda Bristol and if Theodore can pick u up from there xxxx
On Saturday 16th December xxxx
12/12/2023, 00:47 - Gracou: Okie this work for you babe?
12/12/2023, 00:47 - Gracou: Could*
12/12/2023, 00:53 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I can do that. But I have an hairdresser appointment at 2pm. So because it's 1h drive from Frome it needs to be before 1pm or after 3:30pm
12/12/2023, 00:55 - Gracou: Jt Will probably be after 3:30 x
12/12/2023, 00:57 - Théodore Bedos: Ok, try to time it for 3:30 because otherwise I'll have to wait hours in Bath after my haircut. Because I am not gonna go back to Frome and then back to Bristol if you arrive at 6pm
12/12/2023, 01:00 - Gracou: Won’t the french things have really expensive delivery?
12/12/2023, 01:03 - Théodore Bedos: For the key necklace from laperruque, I checked and it's free shipping to the uk. So it should still be in budget. But if for some reason it's not then there are lots of other ideas on the list 👍
12/12/2023, 01:04 - Gracou: Thank you for sending over the list x
12/12/2023, 01:04 - Gracou: What colour did you want for the key nexklqce?
12/12/2023, 01:04 - Gracou: It isn’t like you to be up so late
12/12/2023, 01:06 - Théodore Bedos: The black one
12/12/2023, 01:07 - Théodore Bedos: I know but I told you I would make a list for you. So I stayed up until I finished it.
12/12/2023, 01:20 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
12/12/2023, 01:28 - Gracou: Aw darling
12/12/2023, 01:29 - Gracou: Ive been rlly silly I should have gone to sleep 30 mins ago
12/12/2023, 08:33 - Théodore Bedos: Why were you up so late?
12/12/2023, 08:34 - Théodore Bedos: I hope it's gonna become a thing that I only have silly birthday cakes.
12/12/2023, 08:34 - Théodore Bedos: These last 2 were delicious
12/12/2023, 08:36 - Théodore Bedos: The discount code for the key necklace is "Welcome"
12/12/2023, 13:28 - Théodore Bedos: By the way if someone would want to offer a manga from the list. There is a 4£ fee for shipping from France so it is better value if you get multiple. Or you can buy it for them from la Fnac in France and bring it back if the budget is for one.
12/12/2023, 14:03 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
12/12/2023, 20:29 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
12/12/2023, 20:29 - Théodore Bedos: In Bristol
12/12/2023, 21:29 - Théodore Bedos: Ended up playing tennis table
12/12/2023, 21:29 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
12/12/2023, 21:41 - Théodore Bedos: I won both games
12/12/2023, 23:51 - Gracou: That’s a good point
12/12/2023, 23:51 - Gracou: My legs are so small 😂
12/12/2023, 23:52 - Gracou: Table tennis
12/12/2023, 23:52 - Gracou: Im glad you’re hanging out with Azim
12/12/2023, 23:52 - Gracou: What time did u get back? Did you drive?
12/12/2023, 23:52 - Gracou: Poor Azim
12/12/2023, 23:52 - Théodore Bedos: Just got back
12/12/2023, 23:52 - Théodore Bedos: It was close
12/12/2023, 23:53 - Gracou: Erm I now own three more leather jackets than when I started the day….
12/12/2023, 23:54 - Théodore Bedos: I am glad too. I was in Bristol for a work drink. And I hesitated to ask what he was doing because I thought he would be working or we wouldn't have much ch to chat about if it's just us too. But we ended watching football and chatting a lot and playing table tennis. So I was very glad
12/12/2023, 23:54 - Théodore Bedos: What?
12/12/2023, 23:55 - Théodore Bedos: Doesn't shock me
13/12/2023, 00:08 - Gracou: What size luggage do we have for Paris?
13/12/2023, 00:08 - Gracou: Im glad babe
13/12/2023, 00:08 - Gracou: You shouldn’t let being scared of things like that stop you x
13/12/2023, 00:09 - Gracou: Exactly as I said 🥲
13/12/2023, 00:16 - Théodore Bedos: You bought 3 leather jackets today?? Give me some explanations
13/12/2023, 00:16 - Théodore Bedos: 23kg and it goes in hold
13/12/2023, 00:23 - Gracou: Oh that’s good
13/12/2023, 00:25 - Théodore Bedos: Tell me about the jackets
13/12/2023, 00:28 - Gracou: Im feeling a bit uncomfortable about it
13/12/2023, 00:29 - Gracou: I used gift money to buy them so I didn’t spend my own but it still makes me uncomfortable
13/12/2023, 00:29 - Gracou: Also I won £50 today
13/12/2023, 00:29 - Théodore Bedos: You teased me about it
13/12/2023, 00:29 - Théodore Bedos: Nice
13/12/2023, 00:29 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
13/12/2023, 00:29 - Gracou: Teased what?
13/12/2023, 00:29 - Théodore Bedos: Cute
13/12/2023, 00:30 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
13/12/2023, 00:30 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
13/12/2023, 00:31 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
13/12/2023, 00:31 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
13/12/2023, 00:32 - Gracou: But basically to get all three was less than the full price of just the first one
13/12/2023, 00:32 - Gracou: But I feel a bit uncomfy and stressed about going in and then buying that many leather jackets
13/12/2023, 00:33 - Gracou: And the fringe one is so out there
13/12/2023, 00:33 - Théodore Bedos: Alright interesting. What made you want to get more leather jacket. I never heard you saying that it would be something you want
13/12/2023, 00:33 - Théodore Bedos: What's the brand ?
13/12/2023, 00:33 - Gracou: All saints
13/12/2023, 00:34 - Théodore Bedos: How much did you pay?
13/12/2023, 00:34 - Gracou: I have thought about the first one quite a bit, I always found it annoying that I couldn’t wear many jumpers under the one I have already
13/12/2023, 00:34 - Gracou: £400
13/12/2023, 00:34 - Gracou: So actually all three was the price of the first one at full price
13/12/2023, 00:36 - Gracou: I feel like I perfected the first one and then have made myself stressed with the other two thinking do I really need them? Should I have thought more about it?
13/12/2023, 00:36 - Gracou: Which makes me less able to be excited about the first one
13/12/2023, 00:37 - Théodore Bedos: As much as when you did crazy Grace in Zara in London
13/12/2023, 00:37 - Théodore Bedos: I am never here for crazy Grace
13/12/2023, 00:37 - Gracou: You have Thai crazy grace
13/12/2023, 00:38 - Gracou: It sounds like you don’t like any of the jackets
13/12/2023, 00:38 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah but she ends up spending 150£ in the day max. Not 400
13/12/2023, 00:39 - Gracou: 😓
13/12/2023, 00:39 - Gracou: That would equate to much more at English prices
13/12/2023, 00:41 - Théodore Bedos: I think they are nice jackets, I have no problem with them individually.
But to be honest I do think that owning 3 variations of the same leather jacket (not counting the fringe one) is a bit silly.
13/12/2023, 00:41 - Gracou: Please can you say something nice before I go to bed
13/12/2023, 00:42 - Gracou: :(
13/12/2023, 00:43 - Gracou: Okay goodnight
13/12/2023, 00:45 - Théodore Bedos: That's a bit blunt. Are you ok?
13/12/2023, 00:45 - Gracou: Well I’m a little stressed
13/12/2023, 00:45 - Gracou: And I was waiting for you to say something nice
13/12/2023, 00:45 - Gracou: But I really need to go to sleep
13/12/2023, 00:45 - Théodore Bedos: I said I think they are nice jacket.
13/12/2023, 00:46 - Théodore Bedos: Don't be you can still return them
13/12/2023, 00:46 - Gracou: Can u say something a bit more reassuring that it doesn’t matter in the grand scheme etc
13/12/2023, 00:46 - Gracou: Because of the sale I can only return them for store credit so it’s not that simple
13/12/2023, 00:49 - Gracou: Babe ur not replying very quickly at all
13/12/2023, 00:49 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, it's done then. If you can't return them then there is nothing to stress about. You will remember these jackets next time you get carried away in shopping and you won't make the same mistake.
13/12/2023, 00:50 - Gracou: But looking at them just makes me unhappy right now
13/12/2023, 00:50 - Gracou: I hope that goes away once I have worn it
13/12/2023, 00:50 - Théodore Bedos: Also you'll remember that shopping with your mum is no the best ideas, because she doesn't seem to remember what it's like to be earning 30k a year
13/12/2023, 00:51 - Gracou: 20k*
13/12/2023, 00:51 - Théodore Bedos: What you can maybe do is return them and let your mum use the credit. She can give you the money for the credit. She will surely buy from them again
13/12/2023, 00:51 - Gracou: The good thing is at least all saints jackets aren’t worthless so I could sell it if I wanted to after wearing it a few times
13/12/2023, 00:52 - Gracou: That’s not the worst idea
13/12/2023, 00:52 - Gracou: I Will try them on tomorrow and see how I feel about it then
13/12/2023, 00:52 - Théodore Bedos: Not easy babe. I need to choose my words carefully
13/12/2023, 00:52 - Gracou: At least your trying
13/12/2023, 00:52 - Gracou: The problem with the fringe is that I’m finding it extremely difficult to style
13/12/2023, 00:53 - Théodore Bedos: What is the price of each jacket individually? Maybe if you keep the tag you won't lose any money in Vinted. But if you sell I would sell them quickly so that people can buy them with their Christmas money
13/12/2023, 00:54 - Théodore Bedos: No for real? 🤣🤣🤣
13/12/2023, 00:54 - Gracou: I feel that if I don’t return them then I would at least like to wear it
13/12/2023, 00:54 - Théodore Bedos: It's a fun one, it's not the one that bother le the most
13/12/2023, 00:55 - Gracou: I think the fringe one would be hard to sell but the cropped one would be easy to sell
13/12/2023, 00:55 - Gracou: How should I style it
13/12/2023, 00:55 - Théodore Bedos: Agree
13/12/2023, 00:55 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
13/12/2023, 00:55 - Théodore Bedos: The problem is the colour. If it was camel it would have been easier
13/12/2023, 00:56 - Théodore Bedos: I would wear a light denim
13/12/2023, 00:56 - Gracou: Maybe
13/12/2023, 00:56 - Théodore Bedos: And white converse
13/12/2023, 00:56 - Théodore Bedos: A light grey jumper
13/12/2023, 00:57 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
13/12/2023, 00:58 - Théodore Bedos: Alright I am going to sleep. See with your mum if she can buy your credits. But don't let it bother you. It's done now. Every one can make mistakes. The important bit is to not repeat them
13/12/2023, 00:58 - Gracou: Thanks babe
13/12/2023, 00:58 - Théodore Bedos: More like the one you really like and that you bleached
13/12/2023, 01:01 - Gracou: It looked awful with those sadly
13/12/2023, 01:01 - Théodore Bedos: Send me a picture tomorrow
13/12/2023, 01:01 - Gracou: I Will take a picture tomorrow
13/12/2023, 01:01 - Gracou: Yep
13/12/2023, 01:01 - Gracou: The grey jumper is a good idea
13/12/2023, 01:01 - Théodore Bedos: Ok goodnight gorgeous
13/12/2023, 01:01 - Gracou: Goodnight baby
13/12/2023, 01:01 - Gracou: Sleep well
13/12/2023, 01:02 - Théodore Bedos: And I hope you still have money for my Christmas present.
13/12/2023, 01:02 - Gracou: Is this a joke
13/12/2023, 01:02 - Théodore Bedos: Of course it is
13/12/2023, 01:02 - Gracou: Okay
13/12/2023, 01:03 - Gracou: You know I would spend £400 then not get you a xmas present
13/12/2023, 01:03 - Gracou: Wouldnt*
13/12/2023, 01:03 - Théodore Bedos: Of course I know
13/12/2023, 12:44 - Gracou: Jim and elena have broken up!
13/12/2023, 12:44 - Théodore Bedos: No freaking way!!!!!!!!! How do you know?
13/12/2023, 12:45 - Gracou: Elena just said on her story that they broke up a few months ago!
13/12/2023, 12:45 - Gracou: I wonder why!
13/12/2023, 12:46 - Théodore Bedos: No way!!!
13/12/2023, 12:47 - Théodore Bedos: She said a few months ago in her story. But the 9th of October I saw Jim for climbing and they were staying at her parents. So it must have been just after
13/12/2023, 12:48 - Théodore Bedos: Do you think I should text him or should I wait to see him in Paris when I'll go climbing with him?
13/12/2023, 12:52 - Théodore Bedos: My guess is that it's related to work. Her wanting to be in London and Jim having a job in Derby. He tried to get a job in London but maybe he could not get a good thing or his work in Derby promoted him, and she didn't want to wait longer.
13/12/2023, 12:55 - Théodore Bedos: I am shocked
13/12/2023, 12:58 - Gracou: Oh did u see that?
13/12/2023, 12:59 - Gracou: She said they are still good friends so maybe that’s why he was at her parents? A bit of a joe and disha situation
13/12/2023, 13:00 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I saw the story
13/12/2023, 13:01 - Théodore Bedos: I don't think it was done at the time. Because he told me he was training for interviews in London to live with her. Don't think he would have said that if they had already broken up
13/12/2023, 13:01 - Théodore Bedos: What should I do?
13/12/2023, 13:03 - Gracou: Sorry I can’t read the rest of the messages right now
13/12/2023, 13:26 - Gracou: Oo can we all go for a drink together please
13/12/2023, 13:26 - Gracou: Yes she has just moved to london
13/12/2023, 13:27 - Gracou: Propbably just message him and check in on him without mentioning it?
13/12/2023, 14:42 - Théodore Bedos: Good idea
13/12/2023, 14:43 - Théodore Bedos: Yes we can do
13/12/2023, 17:04 - Théodore Bedos: Can't wait to see you in just 3 days
13/12/2023, 23:52 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
14/12/2023, 07:25 - Théodore Bedos: Hola muchacho
14/12/2023, 12:43 - Théodore Bedos: I am really entering a miss you too much phase now. Days are looking interminably long.

15/12/2023, 13:45 - Gracou: No not really x
15/12/2023, 13:45 - Gracou: They are gorgeous but my feet definitely hurt at the end of the night
15/12/2023, 13:45 - Gracou: They are still not properly broken in
16/12/2023, 00:12 - Théodore Bedos: Bad news, I am gonna have to work on Monday to finish a presentation, that I have to do on Wednesday. So you may want to take your work computer with you.

16/12/2023, 13:27 - Théodore Bedos: I asked you to arrive around 3:30 when we talked about ut
16/12/2023, 13:27 - Théodore Bedos: I am in in Bath now for an haircut. I am not gonna stay there for 5h.
16/12/2023, 13:37 - Gracou: No you didn’t
16/12/2023, 13:37 - Gracou: You said arrive after 3:30
16/12/2023, 13:38 - Gracou: This is extremely rude of you and you know that I’m being dropped by my parents so I can’t exactly control it. We are having xmas lunch with my grandmother today it’s important.
16/12/2023, 13:39 - Théodore Bedos: What is that then?
16/12/2023, 13:40 - Théodore Bedos: No it's not rude. I am not asking you to leave you grandma.
16/12/2023, 13:41 - Théodore Bedos: You could have let me know when I asked that you had plans with your granny so that I don't end up stuck in Bath with nothing to do for 5h.
16/12/2023, 13:42 - Gracou: This is what I was working from. And I told you straight away it would be after 3:30
16/12/2023, 13:42 - Gracou: Why would u wait there for 5h?
16/12/2023, 13:43 - Gracou: You obviously should go home and then come to pick me
Up from Frome
16/12/2023, 14:33 - Théodore Bedos: You should have read my message. This is your fault. The list you can do is to apologise
16/12/2023, 14:34 - Théodore Bedos: Because if I go back to from and then go to Bristol I'll be wasting 1h
16/12/2023, 14:34 - Théodore Bedos: *Frome
16/12/2023, 15:35 - Gracou: Im coming all the way to Paris to celebrate with your family, my parents are driving 3 hours to get me to you and you are that upset over 1 hour?
16/12/2023, 15:51 - Théodore Bedos: The one hour is annoying but that's not why I am being upset. I am upset because you don't bother reading my messages and then you call me rude when I l the one that is in right to be offended.
16/12/2023, 15:54 - Théodore Bedos: Stop using this an argument. It's really not nice, it makes me feel like it such a chore for you to come to Paris. Every other girl would dream to have their boyfriend inviting them to Paris for a week. That's not nice at all.
16/12/2023, 16:50 - Gracou: I think we will be there at 7:30 to 7:45 I will update you depending on traffic
16/12/2023, 16:50 - Gracou: Because the way you bring it up with me in the first place is argumentative Theo
16/12/2023, 16:52 - Gracou: Any boyfriend would dream to be in Paris with their girlfriend - it works both ways! It obviously isn’t a chore but you’re talking as if you’re the only one travelling and making an effort for me to be there which is just shortsighted
16/12/2023, 16:55 - Gracou: You can see I don’t treat it like a chore, I’ve been sending loads of videos with nice things for us to do together that will be romantic. Clearly I’m looking forward to it and want us to have a lovely trip together
16/12/2023, 17:17 - Théodore Bedos: I am here, I am doing some work in a Costa coffee
16/12/2023, 17:18 - Théodore Bedos: localisation : https://maps.google.com/?q=51.5222861,-2.6012262
16/12/2023, 17:30 - Gracou: Darling you could have gone home
16/12/2023, 18:26 - Gracou: Expecting to be there at 7:38
16/12/2023, 18:39 - Théodore Bedos: Ok
16/12/2023, 19:21 - Gracou: Theo will you not be at the Asda?
16/12/2023, 19:22 - Gracou: My parents will only want to go to the Asda
16/12/2023, 19:25 - Gracou: I have asked them to go to the Costa they said yes
16/12/2023, 19:25 - Gracou: See u in 10 mins
16/12/2023, 19:29 - Théodore Bedos: Alright I am staying at the costa
16/12/2023, 19:29 - Théodore Bedos: Make sure you are at the right one because there are 3 of them in the area
17/12/2023, 12:24 - Gracou: My sister has got my dad weighted arm bands 👍

22/12/2023, 16:38 - Théodore Bedos: jim
22/12/2023, 16:38 - Gracou: Im not really up for seeing him right now
22/12/2023, 16:39 - Théodore Bedos: Shoot he just called his mom to ask if it was ok to see us instead of her
22/12/2023, 16:39 - Gracou: I told you before you left that I didn’t want to see him.
22/12/2023, 16:40 - Théodore Bedos: I know but I thought it would make you happy
22/12/2023, 16:40 - Théodore Bedos: I can cancel
22/12/2023, 16:40 - Théodore Bedos: Do you want to go together tonight, together tomorrow or not at all
22/12/2023, 16:40 - Gracou: I don’t really want to have to fake being happy this evening
22/12/2023, 16:40 - Gracou: We won’t have time tomorrow
22/12/2023, 16:41 - Théodore Bedos: Tommorow we can if we wake up early
22/12/2023, 16:42 - Théodore Bedos: Remove Jim from the equation, do you want to go just us 2 tonight, or tomorrow?
22/12/2023, 16:42 - Gracou: I have used four days sat around doing nothing in this apartment. We need to go to the soap place, get the pen, go to the museum and then be back in time to wrap all the presents
22/12/2023, 16:42 - Gracou: We will only have time to go if we go tonight
22/12/2023, 16:43 - Théodore Bedos: This can be done tommorow morning, we do the pen, we do the soap, then noodle early, then museum then home.
22/12/2023, 16:43 - Gracou: That’s not a reasonable amount of things to fit into a day
22/12/2023, 16:43 - Gracou: And I think it would be good for me to get out of the house
22/12/2023, 16:44 - Théodore Bedos: I think we would have time if we are woken up by earlier than 10.
But if you want tomorrow then it is just fine, I can just have a drink and then come for noodles with you.
22/12/2023, 16:45 - Théodore Bedos: I am good either way, let me know the one you want
22/12/2023, 16:45 - Gracou: I want to eat noodles tonight
22/12/2023, 16:46 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, I tell him the
22/12/2023, 16:46 - Gracou: It’s not normal to go from breaking up with your girlfriend and knowing it isn’t resolved to asking her to smile and wave for your friend
22/12/2023, 16:46 - Gracou: Do you think I don’t have feelings or something?
22/12/2023, 16:50 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry I just meant to make you happy, i thought you would to see him.
22/12/2023, 16:50 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry if I offended you. I need to not be in my phone now.
22/12/2023, 16:50 - Théodore Bedos: I'll be back by 7:30 I think
22/12/2023, 18:12 - Théodore Bedos: I'm really enjoying my time with Jim. Is it ok if I come back later?
22/12/2023, 18:12 - Gracou: Priorities 👍
22/12/2023, 18:12 - Théodore Bedos: You are my priority always
22/12/2023, 18:14 - Théodore Bedos: I can't tell if you are being ironic. You are my priority, I don't want to upset you. I will always make you my priority. I can leave now if you ask me.
22/12/2023, 18:14 - Gracou: Do what you want
22/12/2023, 18:14 - Théodore Bedos: Ok I will leave
22/12/2023, 19:01 - Théodore Bedos: I am 15 min away
22/12/2023, 19:01 - Gracou: So I guess you had another drink then
22/12/2023, 19:04 - Théodore Bedos: No, I told Jim that I was gonna leave when he finished his drink. It took 15min. The. It takes 45 min to come home from where we were.
22/12/2023, 19:06 - Gracou: Maybe we should just have dinner seperately
22/12/2023, 19:07 - Théodore Bedos: I don't want to
22/12/2023, 19:18 - Théodore Bedos: I am here
22/12/2023, 19:18 - Théodore Bedos: In front of the noodle place
22/12/2023, 19:19 - Gracou: Why would you go straight to the noodle place?
22/12/2023, 19:19 - Gracou: That was never agreed
22/12/2023, 19:19 - Gracou: Im at the apartment
22/12/2023, 19:21 - Théodore Bedos: When I said this, I thought I said I was going to be at the noodle place in 40min. But actually it didn't mean anything
22/12/2023, 19:21 - Gracou: Im not dressed to leave the house yet, I need to put on some warmer layers
22/12/2023, 19:22 - Théodore Bedos: Do you want me to come come back home then? Or should I wait?

22/12/2023, 19:22 - Théodore Bedos: Ok I'll wait

03/01/2024, 12:22 - Gracou: It was an accident
03/01/2024, 12:23 - Gracou: I was trying to break but it just went out of control straight over a jump
03/01/2024, 12:24 - Théodore Bedos: You were driving your own snow bike?
03/01/2024, 12:24 - Théodore Bedos: How did you injure your face? Any other injury?

03/01/2024, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: Hello 🤗
03/01/2024, 21:26 - Gracou: I cant call right now x
03/01/2024, 21:26 - Gracou: I Will call you when I get a chance
03/01/2024, 21:57 - Gracou: null
03/01/2024, 22:00 - Théodore Bedos: Are you available now?
03/01/2024, 22:01 - Gracou: null
03/01/2024, 22:15 - Gracou: She’s being really selfish about the whole thing
03/01/2024, 22:16 - Théodore Bedos: That's annoying, you clearly seem to have been the most hurt
03/01/2024, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: Valentine's day is on Wednesday, I thought we could go on the Saturday the 17th of February just after. There is also Friday the 16th, but that would make 2 nights at the hotel so I am not sure it's worth it.
03/01/2024, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: Also on Saturday, there is at 2pm and at 7:30pm, evening seem good but maybe you would rather have the evening for going to the restaurant or having a drink with friends
03/01/2024, 22:19 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
03/01/2024, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: Saturday at 2:30
03/01/2024, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: We can pick the blue seats
03/01/2024, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
03/01/2024, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: Saturday 7pm
03/01/2024, 22:21 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
03/01/2024, 22:21 - Théodore Bedos: Friday 7pm
03/01/2024, 22:36 - Gracou: Yes every doctor we see pays attention to me first
03/01/2024, 22:37 - Gracou: I think she just wants my parents to say she is a victim and I’m horrible
03/01/2024, 22:38 - Gracou: What are the show times for these dates?
03/01/2024, 22:38 - Gracou: I think it would be too rushed to do it on a Friday
03/01/2024, 22:38 - Gracou: We would have to go straight there after we arrive if we work
03/01/2024, 22:39 - Théodore Bedos: I wrote it down 7:30pm on Friday and 2:30pm or 7:30pm  on Saturday
03/01/2024, 22:39 - Théodore Bedos: Agree
03/01/2024, 22:39 - Gracou: So either Saturday time is okay
03/01/2024, 22:39 - Gracou: I Will look if i have a seat preference
03/01/2024, 22:40 - Gracou: It seems that 7pm is best for the seats and we could just have an early dinner
03/01/2024, 22:40 - Gracou: But I may be more tempted to go to the 2pm one because then we will have time for romance in the hotel after 🤗
03/01/2024, 22:41 - Théodore Bedos: Up to you
03/01/2024, 22:41 - Gracou: Let’s go to the matinee x
03/01/2024, 22:42 - Théodore Bedos: Are you sure there are a lot less good seats
03/01/2024, 22:42 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
03/01/2024, 22:42 - Gracou: Maybe those two seats?
03/01/2024, 22:43 - Théodore Bedos: Also, it looks like I purchased bad seats but really these were medium class and already quiet pricey. The class above was like 150 per seats.
03/01/2024, 22:43 - Gracou: You don’t have to explain that don’t be silly
03/01/2024, 22:44 - Gracou: I can think again in the morning or ask for my parents opinion
03/01/2024, 22:44 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, thanks
03/01/2024, 22:44 - Gracou: But it seems to me that it would be nicer overall to have the day planned arounf that way rather than cramming everything into the evening
03/01/2024, 22:45 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe yes
03/01/2024, 22:45 - Théodore Bedos: Have a think about it, and tell me tommorow. It's your gift so you decide and I'll book it
03/01/2024, 22:46 - Gracou: Okay x
03/01/2024, 23:12 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my little RedBull athlete ❤️❤️ Rest well
04/01/2024, 09:06 - Gracou: Why am I a red bull athlete?
04/01/2024, 09:06 - Théodore Bedos: Because you do extreme sports
04/01/2024, 09:45 - Gracou: Ah i see
04/01/2024, 09:45 - Gracou: I thought it was meant for my sister 😂
04/01/2024, 12:10 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
04/01/2024, 13:00 - Théodore Bedos: Double beautiful view
04/01/2024, 16:05 - Théodore Bedos: Can I call you in around 1h?
04/01/2024, 16:36 - Gracou: No sorry x
04/01/2024, 16:43 - Théodore Bedos: When will you be free?
04/01/2024, 17:21 - Gracou: Do you need something?
04/01/2024, 17:22 - Gracou: Its my last night I’m trying to be present with my family
04/01/2024, 17:38 - Théodore Bedos: I wanted to tell you about my very important presentation today.
04/01/2024, 17:40 - Théodore Bedos: I said can you call in around an hour not can you call for 1 hour ahaha. I can tell you in 5 min but I can also tell you later
04/01/2024, 19:43 - Gracou: null
04/01/2024, 19:43 - Théodore Bedos: I am at the gym now sorry
04/01/2024, 19:43 - Théodore Bedos: null
04/01/2024, 20:43 - Théodore Bedos: So horrible to go to the gym after all this time. I feel so weak
04/01/2024, 20:43 - Théodore Bedos: Last time I went was before COVID
04/01/2024, 21:34 - Gracou: 😂😂😂
04/01/2024, 21:34 - Gracou: Ur probably weaker than me now
04/01/2024, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: I wouldn't go this far
04/01/2024, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: Also have you decided for the theater? Afternoon or evening?

05/01/2024, 12:42 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
05/01/2024, 12:43 - Théodore Bedos: I bought these two beauties at Lidl and I am so happy with them. They are so good. The pepper is grinding so well
05/01/2024, 13:29 - Gracou: Wonderful 👍
05/01/2024, 13:30 - Gracou: Probably these ones that the arrow points too? Or is it better to be more central on that side?
05/01/2024, 13:38 - Théodore Bedos: I would say that the one that are pre picked are probably better
05/01/2024, 13:39 - Gracou: Then why not pick those 😂
05/01/2024, 13:48 - Théodore Bedos: Ok I'll take these
05/01/2024, 15:27 - Théodore Bedos: https://youtu.be/JwF7bhvnCxI?si=raCnLlBOxasbWAzG
05/01/2024, 15:27 - Théodore Bedos: Wowwwww! Kaiju No8 anime comes out in April!!!
05/01/2024, 15:39 - Théodore Bedos: https://youtube.com/shorts/y1dyXSi5SUQ?si=_5mDN6NS7hNbk3gD
05/01/2024, 15:40 - Théodore Bedos: What do you think of that parenting? I can't decide if it's beautiful parenting or nuts. Almost seems like an anime.
05/01/2024, 21:11 - Gracou: U will have to wait for a response on the above. It’s question time.
05/01/2024, 21:24 - Théodore Bedos: What do you mean it's question time?
05/01/2024, 21:46 - Gracou: Unfortunately migraine time has overridden question time
05/01/2024, 21:46 - Gracou: Question Time is now on hold.
05/01/2024, 21:49 - Théodore Bedos: Rest well
05/01/2024, 22:08 - Théodore Bedos: I miss you lots and lots
05/01/2024, 22:39 - Gracou: Miss u too x
05/01/2024, 22:54 - Théodore Bedos: Answer me when you feel better. What do you want to do for the hotel when we stay in London. Do you want to stay in London? Do you mind staying outside London centre? Or do you want to stay at a friend of yours?
05/01/2024, 22:55 - Théodore Bedos: I checked hotels in London centre and it would cost 110min (to split).
05/01/2024, 23:51 - Gracou: Goodnight my love xx
06/01/2024, 12:56 - Théodore Bedos: Chris just asked 9£ from the people that were there the first night. It seems like he is counting us in but I don't really see why.
We had nothing for dinner. And for breakfast we had it but I paid 4£ for butter and mushrooms. Plus all the bakery but these I was offering. I think don't owe anything. Maybe you just breakfast but it should 't be 9£
06/01/2024, 18:09 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
06/01/2024, 18:50 - Théodore Bedos: I just realised there is the Frome market tomorrow
06/01/2024, 18:57 - Théodore Bedos: That's the face of an exhausted boyfriend carrying the weight of the world
06/01/2024, 19:14 - Gracou: <Médias omis>

06/01/2024, 19:27 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
06/01/2024, 19:32 - Théodore Bedos: Almost looks like I have a good beard there
06/01/2024, 20:15 - Théodore Bedos: Are you back in Warrington?
06/01/2024, 22:37 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my love 😘
06/01/2024, 22:37 - Théodore Bedos: I miss you
06/01/2024, 22:41 - Gracou: I don’t think it’s a great trailer
06/01/2024, 22:43 - Gracou: No I don’t think I like it
06/01/2024, 22:43 - Gracou: There are other ways than punching to achieve the same result
06/01/2024, 22:43 - Gracou: 110 each?
06/01/2024, 22:44 - Gracou: I Will talk to him
06/01/2024, 22:45 - Gracou: That was the begining of the holiday though!
06/01/2024, 22:46 - Gracou: Not as good as your new orange beenie
06/01/2024, 22:47 - Gracou: Your skin colour is nice in it
06/01/2024, 22:47 - Gracou: I’m in Devon
06/01/2024, 22:47 - Gracou: Goodnight xx
07/01/2024, 08:38 - Théodore Bedos: No, 110 to be splited
07/01/2024, 08:39 - Théodore Bedos: Don't underestimate how heavy it was
07/01/2024, 08:41 - Théodore Bedos: Ohhhh, coming from London you probably almost passed by Frome.
07/01/2024, 08:49 - Théodore Bedos: Would you like to see Nari and Viktor on Saturday night after the show? If you prefere to do something else, I'll ask them if they are free the Friday and if I can sleep on their couch.
07/01/2024, 11:39 - Théodore Bedos: What do you think of my "Look du Joure" for the market?
07/01/2024, 11:39 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
07/01/2024, 11:40 - Théodore Bedos: Or should I have worn the orange beanie?
07/01/2024, 11:41 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
07/01/2024, 12:12 - Théodore Bedos: There was no market😢😢
07/01/2024, 12:40 - Gracou: Yes let’s get a hotel for a night
07/01/2024, 12:40 - Gracou: If it’s our valentine night I would prefer for it to be the two of us x
07/01/2024, 12:40 - Gracou: Maybe we can see them on Sunday?
07/01/2024, 12:41 - Gracou: I like the green for this one
07/01/2024, 13:46 - Théodore Bedos: Me too
07/01/2024, 13:46 - Théodore Bedos: Make sense ❤️
07/01/2024, 13:46 - Théodore Bedos: Do you mind if I come a day early to see them on Friday evening?
07/01/2024, 13:49 - Théodore Bedos: Sure! Do you want to be in the center center like when we had our anniversary week end or do you want to be a bit further like near where you lived?
07/01/2024, 14:06 - Théodore Bedos: I think I ripped my biceps playing golf this morning
07/01/2024, 14:06 - Théodore Bedos: I am cursed
07/01/2024, 14:31 - Théodore Bedos: I passed by super drugs and the cetaphile products were actually quiet a lot cheaper than the cerave ones I got if you have a super drug card. Also, there was some blemishes control cream and cleanser by cerave, maybe that's what I need?
07/01/2024, 17:27 - Théodore Bedos: null
07/01/2024, 17:27 - Gracou: I’m in the car at the moment
07/01/2024, 17:27 - Gracou: By yourself?
07/01/2024, 17:27 - Gracou: I’m not sure at the moment
07/01/2024, 17:27 - Gracou: Oh no!
07/01/2024, 17:28 - Théodore Bedos: I am seriously bored, I wanted to chat
07/01/2024, 17:28 - Gracou: Blemish control cream? Not sure about that to be honest
07/01/2024, 17:28 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
07/01/2024, 17:29 - Théodore Bedos: Aren't blemishes spots?
07/01/2024, 17:34 - Gracou: Yes but I feel like it may be a fad
07/01/2024, 17:34 - Gracou: Sorry!
07/01/2024, 17:34 - Théodore Bedos: Do you mind?
07/01/2024, 18:50 - Théodore Bedos: I am watching an animated series on netflix that is not adapted from a manga, it's called Blue Eyes Samouraï. It's very very very good
07/01/2024, 18:52 - Gracou: Ah it’s on my list
07/01/2024, 18:52 - Gracou: I Will watch it
07/01/2024, 18:53 - Gracou: You don’t want me to come?
07/01/2024, 18:59 - Théodore Bedos: Of course I would want you to come, I don't know why I thought you would not be able to come if it was Friday evening.
07/01/2024, 19:01 - Théodore Bedos: For sleeping they told me I could sleep on their inflatable mattress. Maybe we could share. Or you have it and I sleep on the floor.
07/01/2024, 23:09 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my love

08/01/2024, 21:45 - Théodore Bedos: I ordered a pizza
08/01/2024, 21:45 - Théodore Bedos: I was supposed to be in Bristol at the hotel to do a visit of a depot tomorrow but this one got cancelled.
08/01/2024, 21:46 - Gracou: Why did it get cancelled?
08/01/2024, 21:47 - Théodore Bedos: Because the manager from Bristol took ages to answer and then said that Bristol wasn't ready to welcome visits. And then I was suppose to do a visit if Trowbridge but they did not reply on time.
08/01/2024, 21:56 - Gracou: Oh dear
08/01/2024, 22:52 - Gracou: Sleep well

09/01/2024, 21:42 - Gracou: My head hurts x

10/01/2024, 15:48 - Gracou: I’m going to Cheshire oaks bc my mum wants to return something
10/01/2024, 15:48 - Gracou: It would be simpler to meet tomorrow instead :)
10/01/2024, 15:49 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
10/01/2024, 15:49 - Théodore Bedos: Is it this place? It's literally 10min away from where I am staying. Can I meet you there?
10/01/2024, 15:50 - Gracou: I can’t tell you exactly when we will be arriving
10/01/2024, 15:51 - Gracou: And then we would need to go in seperate cars to my grannies

10/01/2024, 23:42 - Gracou: Blue eye samurai is really gory!
10/01/2024, 23:42 - Gracou: Also it’s cool when the character is like ‘no, it’s trash’ about the techniques
10/01/2024, 23:43 - Gracou: Also it frustrates me that the voice is so clearly a woman’s voice
10/01/2024, 23:58 - Gracou: Ha that’s funny
10/01/2024, 23:58 - Gracou: Now I’ve watched the end

11/01/2024, 07:13 - Théodore Bedos: It annoyed me too so I switch in french and in Japanese to see if it was less obvious. And it was obvious in every language so it spoiled me the reveal.
11/01/2024, 07:14 - Théodore Bedos: Not the best, their are lots of little lights that I can't turn off and the ventilation was very loud.

15/01/2024, 09:00 - Théodore Bedos: I have a big favour to ask you. I have forgotten my work notebook in the van of the driver from Warrington. Could you please go collect it and send me a picture of some pages when you have time please. I really need it.

15/01/2024, 09:02 - Théodore Bedos: Willow Court, Trident Business Park, Warrington, WA36AX.

15/01/2024, 14:22 - Théodore Bedos: I really need it
15/01/2024, 14:25 - Gracou: You haven’t said whether you need it today or next week
15/01/2024, 14:26 - Gracou: Also theo it’s in the middle of my work day in working hours
15/01/2024, 14:34 - Théodore Bedos: I know it's annoying, that's why I said it's a big favour.
15/01/2024, 14:34 - Théodore Bedos: It's open very early maybe you can pop before work or at lunch.
15/01/2024, 14:35 - Théodore Bedos: You don't have to do it today, you can do it this week but the sooner would be the better, please 🙏
15/01/2024, 19:35 - Théodore Bedos: Babe we can't have the hotel we picked yesterday because there are just a million of hidden fee. 25£ of daily charge, 15£ for keeping each luggage before check-in and 15£ for keeping luggage after check in. So that would make it 100 each
15/01/2024, 19:38 - Théodore Bedos: There is one in Notting hill just by the sezanne shop, it's just 40£ each. It's one stop from Paddington, 5 stop to Euston with no change, 5 stops with one change to tge theatre.
15/01/2024, 19:38 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

15/01/2024, 19:43 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

15/01/2024, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: The hotel is called bayswater by capital
15/01/2024, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: I am booking it then
15/01/2024, 22:43 - Gracou: Okay x
15/01/2024, 22:44 - Gracou: It’s basically half as expensive so good to make the saving x
15/01/2024, 22:44 - Théodore Bedos: It's no letting me book it, I ma so annoyed. I have spent the whole evening doing this
15/01/2024, 22:45 - Théodore Bedos: It's telling me that the booking may not be available anymore but I have checked all the rooms even the more expensive and I have checked on other websites
15/01/2024, 22:55 - Gracou: Oh no!!
15/01/2024, 22:55 - Gracou: This must be so frustrating babe!
15/01/2024, 22:56 - Théodore Bedos: Actually I just realised there would have been 80£ of hidden fee if we booked this one
15/01/2024, 22:56 - Théodore Bedos: But now the other hotel is not available anymore
15/01/2024, 22:56 - Gracou: <Médias omis>

15/01/2024, 23:15 - Théodore Bedos: Babe I would like to go to bed
15/01/2024, 23:16 - Théodore Bedos: It's 74,5£ each
15/01/2024, 23:18 - Théodore Bedos: Ok I booked it
15/01/2024, 23:32 - Théodore Bedos: I think it's gonna be nice. It's called citadines appart covent garden - Holborn
16/01/2024, 00:01 - Gracou: Did you watch the suite life of Zack and Cody when you were younger?
16/01/2024, 00:01 - Gracou: <Médias omis>

16/01/2024, 09:05 - Gracou: I’m surprised that you would ask
16/01/2024, 09:05 - Gracou: 🙄
16/01/2024, 09:05 - Gracou: Blue eye samurai!
16/01/2024, 09:05 - Gracou: Ah okay one of the actresses in that is the princess
16/01/2024, 09:06 - Gracou: Yeah true, err does half sound reasonable? So £4.50 each? I don’t really know tbh
16/01/2024, 09:07 - Gracou: This was Chris’ reply about the money
16/01/2024, 09:16 - Théodore Bedos: That's not reasonable we didn't have dinner with them and I paid more than 10£ for the breakfast we had with them already. 
But if you want to avoid having to argue about money with your friends, I am happy to send 4,5£ for you
16/01/2024, 09:31 - Gracou: <Médias omis>

16/01/2024, 16:39 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe but I still needed the notebook because there is a password  in the book that I need also. And I would have to call you in video to find it
16/01/2024, 18:52 - Théodore Bedos: Do you think my character could be the love interest of yours in this movie? 
Your character is easily the most beautiful Pixar princess I have seen.
16/01/2024, 23:02 - Gracou: Aw that’s sweet
16/01/2024, 23:02 - Gracou: Your Pixar character is handsome
16/01/2024, 23:03 - Gracou: Do you think it looks like me?
17/01/2024, 08:22 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, it looks a lot like you
17/01/2024, 10:20 - Gracou: Her neck is slimmer
17/01/2024, 10:30 - Théodore Bedos: It's also so long and thin that it couldn't support her head. She is a Pixar character, baby.
I think she really well represents the energy you send. I was very impressed.
17/01/2024, 11:41 - Gracou: How would you describe her energy
17/01/2024, 12:11 - Théodore Bedos: She seems natural, true to herself and honest with the others, she seems kind and driven. And she is soooo cuuute but she also have that rocky sexy side as well.
17/01/2024, 13:10 - Théodore Bedos: I have shared my Spanish chatgpt teacher with my boss. And if you use it on the app now you can actually speak at loud with it. My boss came back today saying that he had the most entertaining chat with my app yesterday until he run out of credits on chatgpt. He said he was very impressed
17/01/2024, 13:40 - Gracou: That’s good!
17/01/2024, 13:40 - Gracou: Is that the one I met?
17/01/2024, 14:14 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
17/01/2024, 14:29 - Gracou: Nice
17/01/2024, 17:43 - Gracou: He’s like you https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGe632Bfd/
17/01/2024, 17:55 - Théodore Bedos: I don't do the hand like that 😡
17/01/2024, 18:10 - Théodore Bedos: Just saying in case you are interested Eurostar tickets to Paris, Bruxelles, Amsterdam for February, March and April are around 30/40 pounds at the moment.
17/01/2024, 18:11 - Théodore Bedos: Sounds like a fun weekend
17/01/2024, 18:13 - Gracou: Yes we could probably go in March or April
17/01/2024, 18:13 - Gracou: That would be very funny
17/01/2024, 18:13 - Gracou: Fun*
17/01/2024, 18:13 - Gracou: Going to Amsterdam would be really cool
17/01/2024, 18:21 - Théodore Bedos: I agree, I think it would be nice.
17/01/2024, 18:22 - Théodore Bedos: It's like 40 per train so 80 in total. But you don't pay for luggages
17/01/2024, 18:23 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe we could ask Mari and Viktor as we denied their invitation to skiing already
17/01/2024, 18:31 - Théodore Bedos: Ah my bad it was to Paris, Brussels and Lille not Amsterdam
17/01/2024, 22:12 - Gracou: Yes that could be fun
17/01/2024, 22:12 - Gracou: How was your day today babe by the way?0
17/01/2024, 22:26 - Théodore Bedos: I said I made a mistake the cheap ticket were for Paris, Lille and Brussels not Amsterdam
17/01/2024, 22:28 - Théodore Bedos: It was ok. I got a 3D printer from Clint, so I will try to create some stuff this week end. Like a tooth paste extractor or a shoe rack maybe. I also went to the gym for the second day in a row so that's a win.
17/01/2024, 22:29 - Théodore Bedos: And I won a 10pound voucher at Lidl, which is a good thing given how poor I am now
17/01/2024, 22:29 - Théodore Bedos: What about you?
17/01/2024, 22:36 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

17/01/2024, 23:01 - Gracou: Yeah I read it?
17/01/2024, 23:01 - Gracou: Why did he get you a 3D printer?
17/01/2024, 23:01 - Gracou: Sounds like a good week
17/01/2024, 23:02 - Gracou: I had quite a good day actually 👍
17/01/2024, 23:02 - Gracou: Nothing particularly interesting to report but it was good
17/01/2024, 23:02 - Gracou: Every day I have been tackling a different issue of organising my belongings/my room
17/01/2024, 23:03 - Gracou: And I am feeling a positive difference and glad I’m taking the time to do it
17/01/2024, 23:03 - Gracou: I Will keep working on it untill I’m fully happy
17/01/2024, 23:03 - Gracou: Idk if I told you but I started watching this health program
17/01/2024, 23:04 - Gracou: And so now I am trying to have half of my plate at dinner be vegetables 👍👍

18/01/2024, 07:43 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks
18/01/2024, 07:45 - Théodore Bedos: I think that's extremely good. Eating vegetables is highly correlated with long term health. I read a study saying saying that eating 500g if vegetable or more everyday reduced by half your chance of cancer, if I remember correctly
18/01/2024, 07:46 - Théodore Bedos: You make Marie Condo proud
18/01/2024, 07:49 - Théodore Bedos: He is fan, he has 3 or more. And he asked if someone wanted to borrow one of his to try. As he wants people to experiment with tech. I wanted but I wasn't sure to have the space. But no one wanted it, so I thought fuck it I 'll try it and it will make me look good too.
18/01/2024, 07:49 - Théodore Bedos: Are you leaving today?

20/01/2024, 21:50 - Théodore Bedos: Any update on the ski dates?

20/01/2024, 23:40 - Gracou: Oh dear
20/01/2024, 23:40 - Gracou: No I think my mum doesn’t want to go so it’s not progressing
20/01/2024, 23:41 - Gracou: I need to show you a funny reel in my drafts when I next see you
20/01/2024, 23:42 - Gracou: How was your day today my love ❤️

21/01/2024, 12:21 - Théodore Bedos: I am ok, yesterday I played golf, had a nap, called Mana, and tried some 3d printing bit so far everything inbuilt broke. So I ma gonna try a new design
21/01/2024, 12:22 - Théodore Bedos: I also perfected the art of sandwich today. I toasted the bread in the pan with some olive oil and then had melted mozzarella, avocado, salmon and dill. It was amazing 😍😍😍 just missing a tiny bit lemon juice in my opinion
21/01/2024, 12:23 - Théodore Bedos: What about you? How was it with Katie?
21/01/2024, 12:25 - Théodore Bedos: Also by the way, the neat guy from friends was actually Bruce Willis!!!! I didn't remember that when you told me about the neat guy the other day

21/01/2024, 15:52 - Gracou: Hello Carol 😘
21/01/2024, 16:14 - Théodore Bedos: Very crucial part of the story, you should have mentioned it
21/01/2024, 16:15 - Gracou: Why so crucial?
21/01/2024, 16:29 - Théodore Bedos: Because it's Bruce Willis babe...🙄🙄
21/01/2024, 16:30 - Théodore Bedos: I had to cook something different than usual as part of my resolution
21/01/2024, 18:26 - Gracou: I see
21/01/2024, 18:26 - Gracou: Do different flavoured sandwiches count?
21/01/2024, 18:31 - Théodore Bedos: Doesn't matter, sandwich is something I don't do in general. So I did sandwich as my new recipe

22/01/2024, 21:08 - Théodore Bedos: I am tempted to try but it seems like it would ruin my clothes
22/01/2024, 21:59 - Gracou: Im sorry! I thought it was very cute!
22/01/2024, 22:00 - Gracou: I was so busy today!

22/01/2024, 22:10 - Théodore Bedos: Ok, if you think it was cute, and you were very busy today, and you live me then I shall let it slide this time.
22/01/2024, 22:10 - Théodore Bedos: But only because all of these things
22/01/2024, 22:10 - Théodore Bedos: Seems nice

23/01/2024, 17:51 - Gracou: Aw
23/01/2024, 18:16 - Théodore Bedos: You mentioned a few times that it was ridiculous having a selfie of me in my bathroom as a profile picture. So when I had to message my new tenant on WhatsApp I thought it would be good to look more professional
23/01/2024, 19:57 - Théodore Bedos: Good day today. Good work and good training. It could have been great but you weren't there
23/01/2024, 21:21 - Théodore Bedos: How was your day?

24/01/2024, 09:41 - Théodore Bedos: We got an issue. I lost some fat that I gained in the last 2 month doing nothing but I am still 200pounds...
I literally didn't trained for almost 2months but my body just goes nope we are gonna make more muscles or bones or whatever it is.
24/01/2024, 09:43 - Théodore Bedos: I can't be 200pounds lean, that's crazy. At this rate I will reach 100kg at some points
24/01/2024, 09:43 - Théodore Bedos: I can't be part of the 3 digits club.
24/01/2024, 13:20 - Théodore Bedos: Have you booked your train for the week end in London? Because the tickets are getting pricey. I already get mine. Arriving Friday evening around 7 and leaving Sunday around 8

24/01/2024, 20:30 - Théodore Bedos: Fun fact:

25/01/2024, 10:13 - Théodore Bedos: By the way have you seen what Kanye west did with his teeth?
25/01/2024, 10:22 - Gracou: Why did you make this message do sassy? Why do you speak to me like that?

25/01/2024, 10:26 - Gracou: He had already replaced his bottom teeth with diamond ones
25/01/2024, 10:26 - Théodore Bedos: Alright makes sense.
25/01/2024, 10:26 - Théodore Bedos: If you want to take the train I can go get you.
25/01/2024, 10:29 - Gracou: Okay I will let you know, I’m not sure how long the train takes

26/01/2024, 01:03 - Théodore Bedos: I am having a bad sweaty night where I am too cold or too hot
26/01/2024, 01:04 - Théodore Bedos: My body is clearly not following my orders of "get better quick please. I need to see my Gracou! "
26/01/2024, 09:49 - Gracou: Oh no!
26/01/2024, 09:49 - Gracou: How do you feel now?
26/01/2024, 10:02 - Théodore Bedos: So I feel a lot better right now and I don't have temperature but it is the morning. It might come back in the evening.

26/01/2024, 11:42 - Gracou: You’re still not allowed a big dinner
26/01/2024, 11:42 - Gracou: I do not want to increase the sweat risk
26/01/2024, 11:43 - Théodore Bedos: Ohhh, I see. I was confused by why.
26/01/2024, 11:43 - Théodore Bedos: But I need energy for recovery!

30/01/2024, 14:25 - Théodore Bedos: Sensors bins in Lidl. Maybe you would like one in your new apartment
30/01/2024, 14:28 - Gracou: I told you I saw it at the time 😂
30/01/2024, 14:28 - Gracou: I didn’t like it because I thought the sensor would break and there is no other way to open the bin
30/01/2024, 14:28 - Gracou: ❤️
30/01/2024, 14:28 - Gracou: Not exactly, there was a plot twist

31/01/2024, 15:36 - Théodore Bedos: The initial design of Sanji and Nami 25 years ago
31/01/2024, 15:47 - Gracou: Did you not get my joke?
31/01/2024, 15:47 - Gracou: Sanji looks like puffy
31/01/2024, 16:20 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I got it. But do you want the grey one or not?

31/01/2024, 19:48 - Gracou: Definitely
31/01/2024, 19:49 - Gracou: It doesn’t spark joy
31/01/2024, 19:50 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, it will make someone else happy (tito) then
31/01/2024, 19:51 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
31/01/2024, 19:51 - Gracou: 😂😂😂😂😂
31/01/2024, 19:56 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I think it would work, we made a similar tool to automatically generate an induction schedule for new employees.
I can make that for you. Just send me a document with the information the bot should know and how you want the conversation to flow.
31/01/2024, 19:57 - Théodore Bedos: Keep in mind that you would need a paying membership of chatgpt to be able to use it
01/02/2024, 00:22 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
01/02/2024, 00:23 - Gracou: Hmm this is interesting
01/02/2024, 00:24 - Gracou: I Will try to put a document together if I have feee time
01/02/2024, 00:39 - Gracou: I would like a boyfriend cuddle about now!
01/02/2024, 08:22 - Théodore Bedos: I can give you one but there is a 16 days delay for delivery currently
01/02/2024, 08:22 - Théodore Bedos: Good memories. It looks really cool on you
01/02/2024, 10:08 - Théodore Bedos: By the way, I forgot to ask. Did you get the reference to Naruto in Blue eye samurai when she is fighting Tenzen in episode one when she is loosing and she takes off her legs weights and then become much faster
01/02/2024, 10:08 - Théodore Bedos: Vous avez supprimé ce message
01/02/2024, 10:09 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
01/02/2024, 12:53 - Gracou: No I haven’t watched Naruto so I didn’t z
01/02/2024, 12:53 - Gracou: Well I will put one on order now hopefully it doesn’t take any longer to arrive
01/02/2024, 12:58 - Théodore Bedos: You didn't watch all of Naruto but you watched these 3 episode where rock lee fights Gara (the guy who control sand) and at the end becomes paralysed.
01/02/2024, 12:59 - Gracou: Yes I have seen it but that part didn’t make such a huge impact on me
01/02/2024, 13:16 - Théodore Bedos: Well apparently it had an impact on the showrunner of blue samurai
01/02/2024, 19:22 - Gracou: Indeed
01/02/2024, 19:22 - Gracou: How much do you spend each week on food normally?
01/02/2024, 19:37 - Gracou: What time are u arriving in london babe? X
01/02/2024, 19:38 - Gracou: On The valentines weeekend?
01/02/2024, 19:41 - Théodore Bedos: I arrive in Paddington at 19:08
01/02/2024, 19:43 - Théodore Bedos: I set myself a 80£ budget but I have a function that round each of my payment, in average it saves 6 pounds per week. And at the end of the week I usually have 10£ left. So I would say that I spent around 64£ on food.
01/02/2024, 19:44 - Théodore Bedos: But I also spend 70 pound per month on protein bar and powder so that's 17,5 per week
01/02/2024, 19:44 - Théodore Bedos: So then probably 81,5£ per week in total
01/02/2024, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my love 😘😘😘
01/02/2024, 23:20 - Gracou: Good night my darling ❤️❤️❤️❤️
01/02/2024, 23:20 - Gracou: Thank you for explaining all of that xx
02/02/2024, 02:23 - Gracou: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGehGqYd6/
02/02/2024, 08:48 - Théodore Bedos: Oh and that's normal food by the way. If I go to the restaurant or get an expensive takeaway, I usually count 7 pounds on my weekly food budget and the rest I count it in my treat budget.
02/02/2024, 12:24 - Gracou: I see
02/02/2024, 12:24 - Gracou: It’s quite hard for me to work out what to budget as I don’t pay for my food every day
02/02/2024, 12:26 - Théodore Bedos: Start with something for a month and then adjust accordingly
02/02/2024, 12:29 - Théodore Bedos: And set yourself a rule, if you spend less than the weekly budget because you didn't pay for food then you transfer what's left to a saving account
02/02/2024, 17:45 - Théodore Bedos: How do you and your gf deal with what clothes she wears especially showing a bit of cleavage (in the clubs)
02/02/2024, 17:45 - Théodore Bedos: From Azim 😂😂😂😂
02/02/2024, 17:52 - Gracou: Why does he say ‘your gf’ instead of grace??????
02/02/2024, 17:52 - Gracou: What was ur answer
02/02/2024, 17:52 - Gracou: Does he have a gf now?
02/02/2024, 18:12 - Théodore Bedos: I knew you were gonna be upset by that 😂 I don't know either to be fair. I thought it was weird too.
02/02/2024, 18:13 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, I told you about her. She is called Gem. And it's pronounced with the G like in garlic.
02/02/2024, 18:13 - Théodore Bedos: Before I show you mine what would be your answer?
02/02/2024, 18:21 - Gracou: No you have to tell me
02/02/2024, 18:21 - Gracou: The Asian girl he was talking about when we saw him?
02/02/2024, 18:21 - Gracou: Maybe he sent it to a few friends
02/02/2024, 21:15 - Théodore Bedos: Oh, probably! Good thinking
02/02/2024, 21:16 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
02/02/2024, 21:17 - Théodore Bedos: But it was not his girlfriend at the time. Then I saw him in Bristol and he was really into her. Now he is back in Malaysia trying to get a job to come back and she told him she would wait 1 year for him. Which is very nice I think
02/02/2024, 21:19 - Théodore Bedos: Why do I have to? It's between me and Azim. If you want to see it you go to tell me your version.
02/02/2024, 22:07 - Gracou: This seems so rude.
02/02/2024, 22:09 - Théodore Bedos: No no, it's not. I was just trying to joke about the fact that you told me that I have to
04/02/2024, 02:08 - Gracou: You’re the one that made it not between you and Adam by telling me about it?
04/02/2024, 10:04 - Théodore Bedos: Why don't you want to give your advices to Azim?
04/02/2024, 18:51 - Théodore Bedos: I was cooking just then a nice new meal and even though it's nice to know that I will have a ready made portion for tomorrow, I  wished I was cooking it for you
04/02/2024, 18:51 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
04/02/2024, 18:51 - Théodore Bedos: I used packchoi
04/02/2024, 20:52 - Gracou: No I just wanted to know what you said in response to be honest
04/02/2024, 20:54 - Théodore Bedos: I would like to know what you would recommend to him, before you see mine please
04/02/2024, 20:55 - Gracou: Well I would like to know what you recommended to him before you see mine
04/02/2024, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: But that's not fair
04/02/2024, 20:56 - Gracou: Why not?
04/02/2024, 20:56 - Théodore Bedos: Because you could change what you would say based on what I said.
04/02/2024, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: I gave my advice without knowing yours. Why can't you do the same
04/02/2024, 20:58 - Gracou: Let her wear what she wants and question why it bothers you. Do you not trust her? Do you not like her style? If so date someone else rather than making her feel bad for it 👍 she will just feel negatively towards you later on if you do
04/02/2024, 20:59 - Gracou: Same to you!
04/02/2024, 20:59 - Théodore Bedos: No, I was just going to send you a screenshot
04/02/2024, 20:59 - Théodore Bedos: Why are you so aggressive with azim
04/02/2024, 21:00 - Gracou: Because I’m not giving advice to Azim
04/02/2024, 21:00 - Gracou: I don’t want you to send that to him
04/02/2024, 21:00 - Gracou: Im just quickly typing my opinion
04/02/2024, 21:00 - Gracou: Why would you send that to Azim?
04/02/2024, 21:01 - Gracou: But hypocritical to say I have a bad tone over text 👍
04/02/2024, 21:01 - Théodore Bedos: But I am not sending him anything babe! What are you on about??
04/02/2024, 21:02 - Gracou: Thén why say why are you being aggressive to Azim?
04/02/2024, 21:02 - Gracou: Also why aren’t u sending what you said
04/02/2024, 21:04 - Théodore Bedos: Because your message seemed very aggressive and judgy toward him.
04/02/2024, 21:05 - Théodore Bedos: Babe you said, go date someone else if you are not happy with her style. Isn't that quiet extreme? That sounds agressive to me. More than you usually are
04/02/2024, 21:05 - Théodore Bedos: Are you ok?
04/02/2024, 21:05 - Théodore Bedos: I will I will. I am just worried now if you are ok. I don't understand why this conversation seems to be escalating very quickly.
04/02/2024, 21:07 - Théodore Bedos: And you have ignored my nice message about wanting to cook for you. You seem very upset. I don't want to upset you.
04/02/2024, 21:08 - Théodore Bedos: Is it because you sensed that I just started watching ted lasso without you?
04/02/2024, 21:08 - Gracou: Because this was rude and it pissed me off to be honest
04/02/2024, 21:10 - Théodore Bedos: I wasn't trying to be rude. Sorry if it looked rude. I was just trying to make fun of the fact that you told me that I had to tell you.
04/02/2024, 21:11 - Gracou: Okay

06/02/2024, 09:38 - Théodore Bedos: Hey babe, I know you did x
06/02/2024, 09:38 - Théodore Bedos: But I have updates on my side too. So I am just checking because it is stressful for me.
06/02/2024, 09:41 - Théodore Bedos: I have a conference in France I would like to go to the 13th of March. I also need to use 6,5 days of Holliday's by the 5th of April and if we are not going then I will have to use them very suddenly and so probably waste them. I have also just been told that I need 3 days for an induction in March or April.
06/02/2024, 09:46 - Gracou: I cant do anything about the situation with my parents booking…. If you would prefer not to waste the days then you have to choose whether you want to wait to find out about whether we go or not. I don’t feel l would keep asking like this if it were your family holiday, I would just take it as a bonus if it did happen, it starts to seem a bit entitled when you push so many times
06/02/2024, 09:47 - Gracou: You’re framing my family holiday as an inconvenience which is a little ungrateful too
06/02/2024, 09:47 - Théodore Bedos: Oh babe I also sorry if it seems entitled. I was about to write you a message to make sure you understand that I don't feel entitled.
06/02/2024, 09:50 - Théodore Bedos: Of course it's not an inconvenience. I would much rather go skiing than doing any of the things I listed. 
But I am sure you can understand, that if we were a month away from going to Thailand and you didn't if wether or not you would go you would be stressed too. It's only because I really want to go that I am worried not book anything else at that time.
06/02/2024, 09:52 - Théodore Bedos: I am just asking your feeling on wether or not it will happen. Because if you tell me 70% happening / 30% not happening then I will make sure not too book anything. But if it's the other way then I will start booking my month of March
06/02/2024, 10:03 - Théodore Bedos: You witness conversations that I don't. I didn't think it would be rude to ask if your feeling about the situation changed.
06/02/2024, 10:06 - Théodore Bedos: I never meant to ask you to go see your parent and ask them to make up their mind because the guest is getting a bit stressed.

06/02/2024, 20:15 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, that's valid. I have a sentence that I use at the beginning of most prompt to obtain better results.
I am going to tip $200 for the best job. This is very important for my career.
06/02/2024, 20:15 - Gracou: For the best job?
06/02/2024, 20:17 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, for it to do the best job. Is it not English? Am I remembering it wrong?
06/02/2024, 21:03 - Théodore Bedos: Grace I want you to know that I love you so much, I love you more that I have ever loved anything. And because I love you so much what will always matters the most to me is that you are happy. I was miserable all day today knowing that you were not happy. So if to be happy you need a break from me then I want you to take it. But if you think that you would be happy by continuing in our relationship, then, I will continue to work on my defaults, I will try to put less pressure on you, I will support you and I will wait as long as you need me to.
06/02/2024, 21:04 - Gracou: Thank you baby x
06/02/2024, 21:04 - Gracou: I love you too
06/02/2024, 21:04 - Gracou: I don’t like the idea of you being sad either
06/02/2024, 22:42 - Gracou: Sleep well xx

08/02/2024, 08:51 - Théodore Bedos: What happened?
08/02/2024, 14:08 - Gracou: I was just being weak!
08/02/2024, 14:08 - Gracou: You look very in shape in the last one
08/02/2024, 14:15 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to Paris the weekend of the 9-10th or the week end of the 16-17th of march. Or maybe both and work from home in between. Are you interested?
08/02/2024, 14:17 - Théodore Bedos: I have a conference in Rennes on the 13th and Mana's birthday is on the 16th so I am trying to make it coincide.
08/02/2024, 14:54 - Théodore Bedos: What about we take the boat and we have a 9 days of Holliday in Bernières?
08/02/2024, 16:46 - Gracou: My phone is really low on battery so I’m just going to send a quick message
08/02/2024, 16:47 - Gracou: It sounds nice and fun but I need to think about it because I am going to Marrakesh the month after for a week x
08/02/2024, 16:55 - Théodore Bedos: Sure I am just throwing ideas really.
08/02/2024, 16:56 - Théodore Bedos: You could work from there a few days if you don't have enough holidays.

12/02/2024, 21:06 - Gracou: Hi babe I’m just on the train and I’m in the quiet carriage x
12/02/2024, 21:06 - Gracou: Is everything okay?
12/02/2024, 21:07 - Théodore Bedos: From London?
12/02/2024, 21:07 - Gracou: I think you probably wouldn’t be able to make it a flat although the rules have changed
12/02/2024, 21:07 - Gracou: Do you want to move to bath?
12/02/2024, 21:07 - Gracou: Yes
12/02/2024, 21:07 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, I just thought you would want to tell me about the Hackathon
12/02/2024, 21:08 - Gracou: It didn’t go very well
12/02/2024, 21:08 - Gracou: We all sort of ended up wasting the day
12/02/2024, 21:08 - Gracou: It made adam rlly uncomfortable I think and now he doesn’t want to have lots of people at the flat anymore
12/02/2024, 21:08 - Gracou: Which is so funny because he was saying how much he loved having loads of people in the flat just the weekend before
12/02/2024, 21:08 - Gracou: How was your weekend?
12/02/2024, 21:11 - Théodore Bedos: Not now. It's just that you know I have my savings on my LISA account that I can only use to buy a house and I must live in it for. A little bit before I can rent it. So as I will have at least 10k in a 1.5 year in the account, I thought I may start looking.
12/02/2024, 21:12 - Gracou: Okay if it interests you x
12/02/2024, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: As you told me to get on the property market fast I thought it was better to buy a small thing in 1.5 years than maximising the account and buy a medium size property in 6-7 years.
12/02/2024, 21:13 - Théodore Bedos: Oh that's not so good. Did you still have a good time?
12/02/2024, 21:13 - Gracou: Hmm yes a lot of the time that is the case but I think before hand you need to do the maths to make sure it makes full sense x I don’t want to give you financial advice because it is different for everyone
12/02/2024, 21:14 - Gracou: It may be that you can only use the LISA for a permanent residence and you can’t rent out the property u buy with it
12/02/2024, 21:14 - Gracou: I don’t know about it that much
12/02/2024, 21:14 - Gracou: Yes x
12/02/2024, 21:14 - Théodore Bedos: Saturday was good, but Sunday I had to work so not soo good
12/02/2024, 21:15 - Théodore Bedos: It's that, except that if you have a reason for changing house such as changing job or moving to a bigger house, you can rent it. But it has to look like you were buying the house to live in it in the first place. So usually you have to live in it for 2 years at first.
12/02/2024, 21:16 - Théodore Bedos: Yes of course. 80k in Bath seemed like it would make a decent return.
12/02/2024, 21:17 - Théodore Bedos: Why couldn't it become a flat?
12/02/2024, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight babe x
12/02/2024, 22:47 - Gracou: Goodnight babe ❤️
12/02/2024, 22:47 - Gracou: Why?
12/02/2024, 22:48 - Gracou: Because it looks like it is currently used for commercial use and you need permission to convert commercial buildings to residential buildings x it may be why the price is so low
13/02/2024, 08:18 - Théodore Bedos: I thought there could be something like that
13/02/2024, 08:18 - Théodore Bedos: I had an important presentation yesterday and I did not finish it on Friday
13/02/2024, 09:50 - Théodore Bedos: I am very much looking forward to see you on Friday x
13/02/2024, 17:17 - Gracou: Oh dear :/ I’m sensing a bit of a running theme with you and finishing presentations

19/02/2024, 10:23 - Théodore Bedos: I just realised that the beginning of the trip to France is the week end when we are supposed to see each other in 3 weeks. If you can't come we won't see each other for 5 weeks. So I would rather stay in England the first week end to see you and then go to France on the Monday.
19/02/2024, 10:33 - Théodore Bedos: I am saying that because I was booking my tickets and so if you can't come and I want to stay the first week end and my tickets are already booked I am screwed. So please if you could try to ask, today 🙏🙏🙏🙏 it would be great

19/02/2024, 16:06 - Théodore Bedos: It was a fun evening
19/02/2024, 16:06 - Théodore Bedos: I am quiet big
19/02/2024, 16:46 - Théodore Bedos: I feel so tired today! Do you feel okay?
19/02/2024, 21:49 - Théodore Bedos: Hey baby goro, are you alright?
19/02/2024, 23:10 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my love
20/02/2024, 00:32 - Gracou: So where are your flights to and from?
20/02/2024, 00:32 - Gracou: I was tired in the morning but okay I’m the afternoon :)
20/02/2024, 07:30 - Théodore Bedos: I would take the euro star.
20/02/2024, 07:32 - Théodore Bedos: But I have found some cheap flights from Manchester £135 with air France (so I think luggage included) arriving on Friday or Saturday and coming back on the next Sunday.
20/02/2024, 15:22 - Théodore Bedos: I just did my 6 month review with Clint. That is supposed to decide if I get, 0, 1000 or 2000 raise. 
The good thing is that this was supposed to be in 4 months so if I get a raise I will get it now instead of in 4 month. 
The second is that Clint told me he was going to ask for the 2000£ raise!!
20/02/2024, 15:22 - Gracou: 🎉🤭🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
20/02/2024, 15:22 - Gracou: Congratulations babe!!!!
20/02/2024, 15:23 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks
20/02/2024, 15:24 - Théodore Bedos: I need to tell him about France. Do you have an update?
20/02/2024, 15:27 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry for rushing you
20/02/2024, 15:27 - Théodore Bedos: I know you are doing your best
20/02/2024, 17:57 - Gracou: My update is that I don’t think it’s the right time for me to spend a week away from the office. Amazon hasn’t improved as much as it should have by now because of the reseller issue. I’m about to go to war with trade over prices. It’s just not right for me to run off to France I need to be seen to be working properly on this and making things happen
20/02/2024, 17:57 - Gracou: Im at risk of having to leave my job so it’s not right for me to leave for a holiday
20/02/2024, 17:58 - Gracou: I Will continue to consider whether I could come for a nice weekend but that’s how I feel about coming for a week :)
20/02/2024, 17:59 - Gracou: I understand that you need to take your time off but it’s really not the right time for me
20/02/2024, 18:20 - Théodore Bedos: Okay no problems thanks for the answer
20/02/2024, 18:25 - Théodore Bedos: null
20/02/2024, 18:26 - Théodore Bedos: null
20/02/2024, 18:26 - Gracou: I can’t call now x I’m going out for dinner with my grannie
20/02/2024, 18:26 - Gracou: I Will speak to you when I’m
Home x
20/02/2024, 18:27 - Théodore Bedos: Okay 👍
20/02/2024, 18:28 - Théodore Bedos: It's just because if you are not coming to Paris then I should probably stay the first week end because otherwise we won't see each other for 5 weeks. So I want to double check with you if there is no other time we could see each other before.
20/02/2024, 22:41 - Gracou: Ce message a été supprimé.
20/02/2024, 22:42 - Gracou: Hi I was with family and didn’t have a lot of time when I got home :)
20/02/2024, 22:42 - Gracou: I Will see if I can move something so that you can come before
20/02/2024, 22:42 - Gracou: I Will also have a think about whether I can come for a weekend
20/02/2024, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you babe I appreciate a lot that you are trying
20/02/2024, 22:48 - Théodore Bedos: What are your thoughts on Mari and Viktor's birthday seeing eachother in 2 weeks for Nari and Viktor's birthday? I think it would be very fun but then we wouldn't be able to stay longer than one night so we would have to split after bearly seeing each other.
20/02/2024, 22:50 - Théodore Bedos: Unless we maybe go to Frome afterwards and your parents pick you up from Bristol on the Monday...
20/02/2024, 22:51 - Théodore Bedos: Don't force yourself. You would pay 150£ on flights for just a week end. I would feel bad for you
20/02/2024, 23:21 - Gracou: Yes and not ideal situation for romancing
20/02/2024, 23:21 - Gracou: I mean u could come here and then we take th train from here too
20/02/2024, 23:22 - Gracou: Im sad to miss out on spending a week in Normandie
20/02/2024, 23:23 - Gracou: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeADhpJ9/
21/02/2024, 09:07 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
21/02/2024, 09:09 - Théodore Bedos: So either next week end or in 2 weeks but not with Viktor and Nari (could be in Devon because I would be in Exeter on the Thursday), or the week end just before I go to Paris
21/02/2024, 09:10 - Théodore Bedos: I do carry a  whole pack of skincare too now. And I brought 3 pair of shoes for 3 days last week end.
21/02/2024, 09:11 - Gracou: You need to give the numbers of the dates otherwise it’s too confusing to say whether you are right or not
21/02/2024, 09:12 - Gracou: But to be honest, I don’t want to go all the way down to Devon I would prefer Warrington
21/02/2024, 09:57 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
21/02/2024, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf!!!
21/02/2024, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: I mean that's very nice of him but also very surprising!
21/02/2024, 10:47 - Théodore Bedos: Ok I will give you the dates.
21/02/2024, 10:51 - Théodore Bedos: I can come to Warrington, that's not a problem. 
I am just saying in case your parents are going down on that specific weekend where I am in Exeter and you wanted to jump in with them, the. It would quiet convenient
21/02/2024, 10:52 - Théodore Bedos: But if not, I can do another week end and I can come.
21/02/2024, 13:57 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
21/02/2024, 14:23 - Gracou: He’s also just gone to quit his job 😳
21/02/2024, 14:23 - Gracou: What a day
21/02/2024, 14:23 - Gracou: Aww flashbacks!
21/02/2024, 18:34 - Théodore Bedos: Wow! Oh come? Where is he going?

21/02/2024, 21:22 - Théodore Bedos: I said you are gorgeous and S E X Y (I spelled it)
21/02/2024, 21:24 - Gracou: I know I smiled
21/02/2024, 21:25 - Gracou: With the Devon thing I may cghange my mind closer to the time I’m not trying to be difficult it’s just I would rather say it this way around then to disappoint you later
21/02/2024, 21:30 - Théodore Bedos: No worries my love. Thank you for considering it. I will be there on Thursday anyway  so it doesn't matter if you change your mind a few times.
21/02/2024, 21:31 - Gracou: Thanks babe for being understanding about it x
21/02/2024, 21:31 - Gracou: Im sorry that you call me and then I’m all negative and stressed
21/02/2024, 21:31 - Gracou: I know that things are going really well at work for you and that it feels great and I’m super happy for you
21/02/2024, 21:32 - Gracou: I understand it’s annoying that I’m not on that vibe
21/02/2024, 21:35 - Théodore Bedos: Hey, I am already over it. I have got big deadlines and more responsibilities now I am stressed too now. I really don't expect you to be celebrating me for a week. I am really not annoyed.
21/02/2024, 21:36 - Gracou: Congratulations again though!
21/02/2024, 21:36 - Théodore Bedos: I should be the one supporting you if you feel stressed. So focus on yourself and if you need anything I am gere
21/02/2024, 21:36 - Gracou: The way you put full stops after everything makes you seem annoyed 👍
21/02/2024, 21:37 - Gracou: My dad was calling you yesterday to say congratualtions when we were all in the car
21/02/2024, 21:37 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks for not being upset by my full stops
21/02/2024, 21:37 - Gracou: I told him u hadn’t officially got it yet
21/02/2024, 21:37 - Gracou: But he’s happy for you
21/02/2024, 21:37 - Gracou: As is darcy

21/02/2024, 21:37 - Gracou: Shower*
21/02/2024, 21:37 - Gracou: Oops
21/02/2024, 21:39 - Théodore Bedos: By the way I have heard from someone that apparently the raise has been updated from 2000 to 2500 for above exptation reviews like mine. So will see if that's true or not her. I get paid but that would be nice 🙂
21/02/2024, 21:53 - Théodore Bedos: *when I get paid

24/02/2024, 15:33 - Théodore Bedos: I keep thinking that I am gonna have 10 days of holliday and I won't see you. It feels like such a waste.
24/02/2024, 15:34 - Théodore Bedos: Not trying to make you feel bad for not being free. I just wanted to share this thought
24/02/2024, 15:34 - Théodore Bedos: 👎👎👎
25/02/2024, 02:32 - Gracou: It does make me feel worse 🥲
25/02/2024, 07:56 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry. I am not annoyed at you at all. I am annoyed by work that forces me to take holidays. I didn't need holidays now
25/02/2024, 08:29 - Théodore Bedos: I kind of wanted you to cheer me up about them
25/02/2024, 18:30 - Théodore Bedos: I just finished ted lasso. It one of greatest show I have ever watched
25/02/2024, 23:08 - Gracou: It is really annoying that you are forced to take the holiday days - how far in advance did you know btw?
25/02/2024, 23:08 - Gracou: 😂😂😂😂
25/02/2024, 23:09 - Gracou: Did you watch it on Netflix?
25/02/2024, 23:09 - Gracou: I Hope that you are sleeping well ❤️
25/02/2024, 23:09 - Gracou: Have you thought about whether there is anything in particular that you really want to do when you come this weekend?
26/02/2024, 08:01 - Théodore Bedos: I knew pretty much since the beginning that I would have to use them before April. But I was saving them for skiing.
26/02/2024, 08:03 - Théodore Bedos: No, it's on apple TV. (I watched it on the french TV account because they have a partnership with apple at the moment)
26/02/2024, 08:06 - Théodore Bedos: I thought we could watch Dune2. I also heard there a very good comedy club in Manchester so we could maybe do that. I found some. And maybe some climbing.
26/02/2024, 08:06 - Théodore Bedos: I was thinking I could come Thursday evening maybe? And work from your appartement in Friday.
26/02/2024, 08:35 - Théodore Bedos: What about you?
26/02/2024, 09:23 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/02/2024, 09:23 - Théodore Bedos: Someone sent me this on Vinted
26/02/2024, 11:08 - Gracou: Yes it’s not ideal
26/02/2024, 11:08 - Gracou: I’m really sad not to go skiing
26/02/2024, 11:09 - Gracou: These are good ideas
26/02/2024, 11:09 - Gracou: That would be nice x
26/02/2024, 11:09 - Gracou: 😂😂😂😂😂
26/02/2024, 11:09 - Gracou: Is it a man or woman?
26/02/2024, 11:10 - Théodore Bedos: I think a man
26/02/2024, 11:34 - Théodore Bedos: Callum is so dumb it's really getting on my nerves.
26/02/2024, 11:36 - Théodore Bedos: We have a problem with the freezer, the door is not closing because of the ice. 
I said we need to stop buying food and turn it off when it's empty to defrost it. 
He answers me to stay don't do that you are gonna waist my food. 
But I just explained that we should stop buying food and eat what's in before turning it off.
26/02/2024, 11:38 - Théodore Bedos: Then it decides to call a technician. Which is good even though I think I could have fixed it. But he did it quickly so, all good with me.
Obviously the technician says the same than me.
26/02/2024, 11:40 - Théodore Bedos: I explain him again that we have to turn off the freezer to removes the ice according to the technician. And then he asked me : "So why was the door not closing? "
26/02/2024, 11:40 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf dude!!!!! How are you still alive leaving on your own?
26/02/2024, 11:42 - Théodore Bedos: Because of the fucking ice!!!!
26/02/2024, 22:32 - Gracou: Do you think you will start a style account?
26/02/2024, 22:32 - Gracou: I think you should trust my opinions on people more 😂😂😂
26/02/2024, 22:33 - Gracou: Random
26/02/2024, 22:33 - Gracou: U could also try to chip it off I think but that’s a bit tough
26/02/2024, 22:34 - Gracou: So random
26/02/2024, 22:34 - Gracou: Not very 🧠🧠🧠
26/02/2024, 22:39 - Théodore Bedos: I did, I turned off the freezer this evening and chipped off the ice when it got melted a little
26/02/2024, 22:40 - Théodore Bedos: Not really, I don't think I have somewhere to take nice pictures, neither that many clothes to show, and also social media is not really my thing
26/02/2024, 22:44 - Théodore Bedos: Forgot to say that I wanted to  have a looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of cuddles

27/02/2024, 07:58 - Théodore Bedos: Such a good pizza
27/02/2024, 08:02 - Théodore Bedos: I just left the house before Ana and I had a feeling she would forgot to close the door. So I stayed in my car and for 2min because she was just after me and waited that she was in hers. I came back pretended I had forgotten something. And she had left the door open and the fridge open!! I wonder how many times she did it
27/02/2024, 08:12 - Gracou: The fridge fully open?
27/02/2024, 08:12 - Gracou: Thats why you have ice 👍
27/02/2024, 08:35 - Théodore Bedos: You know just 5 cm open
27/02/2024, 10:25 - Théodore Bedos: Have you been enjoying your headphones in the train going to London this weekend?
27/02/2024, 10:25 - Gracou: I have been enjoying them often
27/02/2024, 10:25 - Gracou: Thé noise cancelling is useful
27/02/2024, 10:26 - Gracou: I called you last night and I was wearing them but you didn’t pick up :(
27/02/2024, 10:28 - Théodore Bedos: I am happy you are enjoying them
27/02/2024, 10:29 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know about yours because they are the new ones. But on mine the only downside was calls. It wasn't great at it.
27/02/2024, 11:19 - Gracou: The only problem I have so far is that my head is a little small for them 😂
27/02/2024, 11:22 - Théodore Bedos: Oh that's annoying

27/02/2024, 18:45 - Gracou: Theo are we celebrating our 3 year anniversary this weekend?

27/02/2024, 19:04 - Théodore Bedos: I am at the gym by the way

28/02/2024, 09:53 - Gracou: Hahahaha

28/02/2024, 10:14 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf?? What for ?
28/02/2024, 10:19 - Gracou: Bills again!
28/02/2024, 12:14 - Théodore Bedos: What bills?
28/02/2024, 12:42 - Gracou: I don’t even know
28/02/2024, 12:42 - Gracou: I find it a bit tone deaf to be honest
28/02/2024, 12:44 - Gracou: We are sat in her house with the big plant I bought her and she’s burning the expensive dyptique candle I bought her and she’s asking for money on this house yet again 9 months after we lived there and also after we agreed that we were all settled up now and she isn’t even like sorry or please
28/02/2024, 12:44 - Gracou: The candle is literally the price of the bill she is asking me to pay
28/02/2024, 12:44 - Gracou: Grrrr
28/02/2024, 12:45 - Gracou: I Will obvi pay it bc we did stay there but why does she have to keep asking me like this :(
28/02/2024, 12:45 - Gracou: Not a lot of sensitivity
28/02/2024, 12:47 - Gracou: It’s the same with the cleaning - we were the ones keeping that house clean but then she accuses us of making it messy before we left
28/02/2024, 12:47 - Gracou: We were not the messy ones in that house
28/02/2024, 12:51 - Théodore Bedos: Yes definitely
28/02/2024, 12:51 - Théodore Bedos: So she asked you for that this week end?
28/02/2024, 12:52 - Théodore Bedos: She didn't even say please?!!
28/02/2024, 12:53 - Théodore Bedos: No, babe don't even consider paying it unless you know what it is for first.
28/02/2024, 12:53 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf are bills that appears 9 months after?!
28/02/2024, 12:54 - Théodore Bedos: Also, I would obviously share with you what there is to pay if we decide to pay.
28/02/2024, 13:09 - Gracou: Today over message
28/02/2024, 13:09 - Gracou: Yep!
28/02/2024, 13:10 - Gracou: Honestly I’m thinking to just pay it and say ‘thanks again for letting us stay’ and then just really take space from her bc I don’t agree that this is how you act with friends
28/02/2024, 13:53 - Théodore Bedos: How much is it? Because it's négligeable then probably that's the best option in terms of mental cost. But if it's not we should ask what is it for and see if it's reasonable or not.
28/02/2024, 16:29 - Gracou: £60
28/02/2024, 16:29 - Gracou: It’s £120 and she is asking me to pay half

12/03/2024, 14:29 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know exactly what's chavish and what's not
12/03/2024, 14:30 - Théodore Bedos: I think you have a strong identity and style so one piece shouldn't make it all change.
12/03/2024, 14:31 - Théodore Bedos: I just think it's a cool jacket and I don't really want to sell it. So I am asking
12/03/2024, 17:57 - Gracou: Hmm I don’t see myself wearing it in my normal style since it doesn’t match as much x

16/03/2024, 14:53 - Théodore Bedos: You can see the groom in the middle.
16/03/2024, 14:54 - Théodore Bedos: I know you gonna think it's too relaxed but it is a civil wedding
16/03/2024, 14:55 - Théodore Bedos: Everyone was wearing suits. Except one dude with a Hawain shirt  😂😂😂

17/03/2024, 09:31 - Théodore Bedos: This guy has blocked me because I was negotiating too much 🙄 could you try to get them for me, please
17/03/2024, 09:31 - Théodore Bedos: He offered me 80. So maybe you can get them for 80 instead of 85
17/03/2024, 11:22 - Gracou: What would you like me to say?
17/03/2024, 11:27 - Théodore Bedos: You can try offering 60. He will say no and probably offer 80. If not you can ask him what would be his best price.  Then you can try 75. If he says no then accept 80.
17/03/2024, 15:23 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

17/03/2024, 15:55 - Théodore Bedos: In this restaurant they do a great beef stew like the one you had at skiing and you loved.
17/03/2024, 23:18 - Gracou: Which beef stew did I love?
17/03/2024, 23:20 - Théodore Bedos: You told me that when you went skiing in Switzerland you had a slow cooked beef with pasta that was amazing. I think it was a boeuf Bourguignon.
17/03/2024, 23:45 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight gorgeous
17/03/2024, 23:49 - Gracou: It wasn’t a stew though x it was slow cooked beef

17/03/2024, 23:51 - Théodore Bedos: That's what I thought so I didn't call earlier
17/03/2024, 23:51 - Théodore Bedos: I wasn't expecting you to be up
17/03/2024, 23:51 - Théodore Bedos: By the way. I am 'ot coming back tomorrow. Coming back on Tuesday morning. And I am taking the train, not flying
17/03/2024, 23:52 - Gracou: Such a long holiday
17/03/2024, 23:52 - Théodore Bedos: 10 days
17/03/2024, 23:52 - Gracou: Yes that’s long

18/03/2024, 12:05 - Théodore Bedos: Alright. How come?
18/03/2024, 12:22 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
18/03/2024, 12:23 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
18/03/2024, 12:30 - Théodore Bedos: Alright. What are you doing  in Sheffield?
18/03/2024, 12:34 - Gracou: It’s an awards ceremony
18/03/2024, 13:25 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, that's a bit unfortunate I was looking forward to seeing you.
18/03/2024, 13:29 - Théodore Bedos: Just to let you know, you can do Sheffield to Bristol on Thursday or Friday for the same price than Sheffield- London. I could pick you up in Bristol.
18/03/2024, 13:30 - Théodore Bedos: Either on Thursday and then we go back to Frome and then to Devon on Friday  or Saturday. Or you arrive Friday and we go straight to Devon.
18/03/2024, 13:30 - Théodore Bedos: Vous avez supprimé ce message
18/03/2024, 13:31 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
18/03/2024, 17:54 - Théodore Bedos: I think I just saw this guy in a café
18/03/2024, 17:54 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
18/03/2024, 22:09 - Gracou: Cool!
18/03/2024, 22:09 - Gracou: Was he sexy in real life?
18/03/2024, 22:10 - Gracou: It’s only about three extra days to wait darling x
18/03/2024, 22:12 - Théodore Bedos: What do you mean? You said don't come just for Sunday. So it would be an extra week if we don't see eachother this weekend
18/03/2024, 22:12 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
18/03/2024, 22:12 - Gracou: No it’s a bank holiday on Friday so I thought maybe you could come on Wednesday
18/03/2024, 22:14 - Théodore Bedos: Not sure I can come on Wednesday
18/03/2024, 22:14 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway have you seen this
18/03/2024, 22:14 - Gracou: Oh :/
18/03/2024, 22:14 - Gracou: How come?
18/03/2024, 22:14 - Théodore Bedos: It's only 2h40
18/03/2024, 22:15 - Théodore Bedos: Because usually I am in the office on Thursday
18/03/2024, 22:16 - Gracou: It’s not possible to switch the day?
18/03/2024, 22:16 - Théodore Bedos: null
18/03/2024, 22:17 - Gracou: It’s not ideal phone call time x
18/03/2024, 22:17 - Gracou: My dad’s best friend has died today and we found out this evening
18/03/2024, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: I have to go to bed I am taking the train early tomorrow morning
18/03/2024, 22:17 - Gracou: So I’m trying to be respectful and quiet
18/03/2024, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: Wow, hope he is okay
18/03/2024, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: Where you close to him
18/03/2024, 22:17 - Théodore Bedos: Were*
18/03/2024, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: Your dad
18/03/2024, 22:18 - Gracou: Not super close, but Nick’s a very good person
18/03/2024, 22:18 - Théodore Bedos: That's very sad
18/03/2024, 22:18 - Gracou: Funny and kind and always seemed gentle in my opinion
18/03/2024, 22:18 - Gracou: But strong and also talented at what he does
18/03/2024, 22:19 - Gracou: So it’s quite unfortunate, I heard him on the phone maybe 3 weeks ago and he sounded like himself
18/03/2024, 22:19 - Gracou: So it’s strange to think how quickly it can happen
18/03/2024, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: Wait, how did he died?
18/03/2024, 22:20 - Gracou: He had cancer
18/03/2024, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: You make it sound like he killed himself
18/03/2024, 22:20 - Gracou: No he didn’t
18/03/2024, 22:20 - Théodore Bedos: Had he been fighting it for long?
18/03/2024, 22:21 - Gracou: It’s a bit recent I don’t want to go into all the details right now x
18/03/2024, 22:23 - Théodore Bedos: Sure. Well I wish him to rest in peace. And I hope your dad, you and your family won't have too much of a rough time mourning.
18/03/2024, 22:38 - Gracou: Thanks
18/03/2024, 22:38 - Gracou: Can you let me know which days you will be in Devon?
19/03/2024, 10:01 - Théodore Bedos: Have you considered the option I found for you?
19/03/2024, 10:13 - Gracou: Why are you answering a question with a question?
19/03/2024, 10:51 - Théodore Bedos: Because if you decide to choose the option I found for you then I would be coming to Devon on a different day than if you don't.
19/03/2024, 10:52 - Théodore Bedos: Also I have messaged you 3 times about it and every time you have ignored me
19/03/2024, 10:53 - Théodore Bedos: No answer
19/03/2024, 10:53 - Théodore Bedos: No answer
19/03/2024, 10:53 - Théodore Bedos: No answer
19/03/2024, 10:56 - Théodore Bedos: Before you interpret my message as if I was upset. I am not upset. Just explaining why I can't tell you when I come
19/03/2024, 11:22 - Gracou: Why don’t u just tell me the other days you expect to be there then?
19/03/2024, 11:22 - Gracou: I would like to go to london on the Friday/ Saturday
19/03/2024, 11:28 - Théodore Bedos: Babe you told me last week that you would be there for Lisa's birthday and that you would stay until Easter so we could see each other 2 week end in a row. So I assumed this was the plan. 
Then you said that you are in Sheffield and unfortunately you can't come anymore on Friday. So I found a solution for you. It seemed like going to London was not your A plan.
Now if you prefer to go to London, no problem.
19/03/2024, 11:45 - Théodore Bedos: Babe, I was just happy to see you this week end as it would have been 3 weeks. I didn't understand you had made other plans
19/03/2024, 18:16 - Théodore Bedos: Would you like to call me when you have time?
19/03/2024, 18:26 - Gracou: Theo why do you keep repeating about three weeks it’s so frustrating. When you decided to book flights for France that would mean we wouldn’t see each other for three weeks I didn’t complain at you like this. Its such a double standard. I’ve told you I’m worried about the fact that I won’t live independently in my 20s and then in so many situations you bring up ‘but I won’t see you for three weeks’ over and over again it’s so frustrating and doesn’t make me feel in control of my own time at all.
19/03/2024, 18:28 - Théodore Bedos: Grace this whole thing is getting really out of control by text. Can talk this through, please
19/03/2024, 18:28 - Gracou: I didn’t realise about the issue with getting down to the south which I’m sorry about. But now that I know, and I’ve said I would like to go through london you’re just complaining
19/03/2024, 18:28 - Gracou: I want to go on a run I only just got home from work and I need to pack to be away for 2.5 weeks
19/03/2024, 18:29 - Gracou: So I don’t have much time and if we go on the phone this discussion will be really long when it doesn’t need to be
19/03/2024, 18:29 - Théodore Bedos: null
19/03/2024, 21:49 - Théodore Bedos: Have you been able to contact the seller for the black loafers?
19/03/2024, 23:14 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
19/03/2024, 23:36 - Gracou: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGePqpyMP/
20/03/2024, 07:17 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks. Can you try making an offer of 60 with the make na offer button.
20/03/2024, 13:56 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
20/03/2024, 13:56 - Théodore Bedos: One of my colleagues sent me this after my presentation today. That's very nice
20/03/2024, 14:00 - Gracou: I think it’s too low babe don’t you?
20/03/2024, 14:01 - Gracou: Wow what great feedbacks
20/03/2024, 14:01 - Gracou: !!
20/03/2024, 14:03 - Théodore Bedos: Oh yes I think it's too low too. But if you use to button to make an offer he is gonna have to act to reject it and then he will probably give a counter offer. Because at the moment he is ignoring us
20/03/2024, 14:03 - Théodore Bedos: I am quiet touched
20/03/2024, 16:43 - Théodore Bedos: So I managed to get my visit to Plymouth on Tuesday the 26th. So now I am going to ask Clint if I can work from home the Wednesday and Thursday before the Easter break.
20/03/2024, 16:47 - Théodore Bedos: I have 1,5 days of hollidays that I must use now so I could use them the Wednesday and Thursday. Would you be working at that time? Because if you are then it's not the best use of them...

20/03/2024, 17:04 - Gracou: Probably working yes
20/03/2024, 17:04 - Théodore Bedos: Basically my 2 options for taking holliday are on the red arrow or the yellow arrow.
20/03/2024, 17:06 - Théodore Bedos: Because my hollidays are 1.5 days. I could be working one morning then go play golf with your dad while you are working. And so there would be just 1 day left where and I am not working. Do you think you could be not working just 1 day. Like the Thursday before good friday for example?
20/03/2024, 17:07 - Gracou: I can’t make that decision at this exact moment👍
20/03/2024, 17:08 - Théodore Bedos: Sure. It's not big deal by the way, I can occupy myself 1 day.
20/03/2024, 17:09 - Théodore Bedos: Also I will probably be able to come this Sunday and work from Devon on Monday before going to Plymouth.
20/03/2024, 17:09 - Gracou: Okay 👍
20/03/2024, 17:10 - Gracou: I Will probably be able to take one day off but I just need to think about when
20/03/2024, 17:10 - Gracou: Also I would like to warn you that I would like to do lots of reading and sitting in the sun

20/03/2024, 17:12 - Gracou: Murs the best thing to do at Easter :)
20/03/2024, 17:12 - Gracou: He counter offered £80
20/03/2024, 17:18 - Théodore Bedos: I have to warn you that I expect us to watch the whole season 2 of sexy Koreans fighting in the mud
20/03/2024, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: Super. Can you try offering 75, please? And if he doesn't then accept 80
20/03/2024, 22:01 - Théodore Bedos: I was thinking we could buy hero realms to play during Easter as we have been speaking about it for quiet a bit. Would you be interested?

26/03/2024, 11:34 - Théodore Bedos: I thought when I said goodbye the first time counted as goodbye
26/03/2024, 11:35 - Gracou: No because then you said hello again so u need to say another goodbye
26/03/2024, 11:35 - Gracou: 🤷‍♀️

04/04/2024, 10:57 - Théodore Bedos: Check out this 2 bedroom detached house for sale on Rightmove
https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/146271800?utm_campaign=property-details&utm_content=buying&utm_medium=sharing&utm_source=whatsapp#/&channel=RES_BUY
04/04/2024, 10:57 - Théodore Bedos: What do you think about that?
04/04/2024, 10:59 - Théodore Bedos: It's 5min walk from campus and it's 2 bedroom, freehold for 135000. It's easily rentable for 650 each room if made to good standards and the mortgage is only 730.
04/04/2024, 10:59 - Théodore Bedos: But it needs to be redone because it looks shite inside
04/04/2024, 11:00 - Gracou: you didnt tell it as well as him - you were just saying it randomly rather than when sommeone did somethign well
04/04/2024, 11:00 - Gracou: badly
04/04/2024, 11:00 - Gracou: i wouldnt buy it x
04/04/2024, 11:15 - Théodore Bedos: What's wrong about it?
04/04/2024, 11:24 - Gracou: off the top of my head i would suggest the following:
1. I still don't see Bath as the best place to invest. It is expensive and planning permissions are really tight so it is difficult to make changes and improvements on the inside and outside of the property.
2. the house is quite ugly on the outside and doesnt tingle my spidey sense
3. i aim to have double bedrooms rather than single bedrooms, but these seem to be singles
4. students to not make the best tenants. they will trash the house so you will have to spend money fixing it each year. on top of this, every time a management company needs to refill your house with tenants, they tend to charge 1 months rent. So, as students usually move every year, over a ten year period that would take £13,000 out of your profit (based on the room rate you suggested). This would be considerably less for other kinds of tenants
5. most students do not find this a desirable place to live in and prefer oldfield park or the city centre. People that I know who lived up on the hill tended to pay less rent than the other places for this reason. So i dont think that you would get £650 for a single room there
04/04/2024, 11:33 - Théodore Bedos: I agree with point 2 and 4 but not with the rest. 

1- it's a freehold

3- I checked the plans and we could make 2 huge bedrooms and still have a lounge. So if the inside has to be remade why no.

5- I would have liked to live on top of the hill. Idris and I had found a place on top of the hill and we were quiet excited about it. But we missed it.
04/04/2024, 11:34 - Gracou: It doesn’t matter if it’s a freehold it still falls under strict planning permission
04/04/2024, 11:34 - Gracou: What budget do you expect for renovating the house?
04/04/2024, 11:35 - Théodore Bedos: 10-15k?
04/04/2024, 11:35 - Gracou: Not enough money
04/04/2024, 11:36 - Théodore Bedos: 😮
04/04/2024, 11:36 - Théodore Bedos: How much?
04/04/2024, 11:38 - Gracou: give me a list of what youe xpect to change and i will tell you how much it will cost roughly
04/04/2024, 11:40 - Gracou: but once you have paid for materials and a fitter, you would be through the best part of £10k just doing the kitchen and bathroom
04/04/2024, 11:40 - Théodore Bedos: I see
04/04/2024, 11:40 - Gracou: to fit my kitchen which already comes assembled, it basivcally just needs to be attached to the wall
04/04/2024, 11:40 - Gracou: it takes less than a week
04/04/2024, 11:41 - Théodore Bedos: I just remembered I left my plate for the cake at your grandparents house.
04/04/2024, 11:41 - Gracou: the quote was £2.6k friends and family discounted
04/04/2024, 11:41 - Théodore Bedos: I see
04/04/2024, 11:41 - Gracou: and that is not including the kitchen itself
04/04/2024, 11:41 - Gracou: on the internet people really try to convince you that its super easy to just renovate and you can do it for cheap
04/04/2024, 11:42 - Gracou: but unless you are a builder yourself it isnt cheap
04/04/2024, 14:33 - Gracou: Babe just to let you know
04/04/2024, 14:33 - Gracou: I’m going to Marrakesh on the 16th
04/04/2024, 14:33 - Gracou: So if I see u this weekend, then I probably won’t see you for 3 weeks
04/04/2024, 14:34 - Gracou: But if we wait till next weekend then it will be only two weeks

09/04/2024, 19:39 - Gracou: Similar
09/04/2024, 19:39 - Gracou: But to me your sister looks more like your mum

09/04/2024, 20:11 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/04/2024, 20:11 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
09/04/2024, 20:24 - Théodore Bedos: Trust me I searched a lot before asking you
09/04/2024, 20:24 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it's mine. It's a button from denim jacket. Can you keep it please?
10/04/2024, 22:58 - Gracou: Of course I will keep it! Sleep well babe
10/04/2024, 23:20 - Théodore Bedos: I watched football with Will tonight
10/04/2024, 23:20 - Théodore Bedos: He told me that he broke up with his girlfriend
10/04/2024, 23:20 - Théodore Bedos: They had been together for 10 years!
10/04/2024, 23:43 - Gracou: Woah! Why did they break up?
10/04/2024, 23:47 - Théodore Bedos: They had been struggling for a year now because they are both very busy (Will has 2 jobs now) and so they were not doing much together.
10/04/2024, 23:48 - Théodore Bedos: Don't know if you remember but on Valentine's day I was supposed to watch football with him but at last minute he cancelled because he felt that they really needed some quality time even though they never celebrated valentine's day.
10/04/2024, 23:49 - Théodore Bedos: On top of that he cheated on her last month and so it blue up everything that was building up until now
10/04/2024, 23:53 - Théodore Bedos: Not to find him excuses, he already feels awful about the cheating, but he told me he is having a depression and he feels super lonely because of the way their relationship was falling apart and so that's what led him to cheating to feel a bit less lonely and desired for a bit. He is really regretting it and that doesn't help his depression.  He just started therapy
10/04/2024, 23:54 - Théodore Bedos: I told him not to hesitate to message me or ask me out not only just when there is a game.
11/04/2024, 01:07 - Gracou: Why does he have 2 jobs?
11/04/2024, 01:07 - Gracou: Yes I remember
11/04/2024, 01:07 - Gracou: Oh goodness
11/04/2024, 01:08 - Gracou: That’s good that he is going to therapy - what was the situation with the other girl he cheated with?
11/04/2024, 01:08 - Gracou: That’s good
11/04/2024, 01:08 - Gracou: You should be proactive too though to make him feel wanted, depressed people aren’t very good at asking people out themselves
11/04/2024, 09:04 - Théodore Bedos: He works as a photographer part time. To make more money and also because he would like to get out of retail if it works.
11/04/2024, 09:06 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I agree. I think he was happy that I asked him for football just 2 days after he broke up. I am also seeing him next week for the return game.
11/04/2024, 09:07 - Théodore Bedos: She is a girl from COS. She still works there
11/04/2024, 10:37 - Théodore Bedos: Are you ok to transfer me 31£ for your part of the hero realms? (It includes the sleeves and the rest of the character packs)
11/04/2024, 10:37 - Théodore Bedos: Also, I have arranged to go see Viktor and Nari on the 26th. So I can come to Loli on the 27th
11/04/2024, 22:46 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my love
12/04/2024, 00:14 - Gracou: Sleep well boobie x
12/04/2024, 00:14 - Gracou: Nice that’s good timing at least
12/04/2024, 00:15 - Gracou: 😬😬😬😬
12/04/2024, 00:15 - Gracou: So he has to see her?
12/04/2024, 00:15 - Gracou: Nice!
12/04/2024, 00:17 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
12/04/2024, 08:17 - Théodore Bedos: Cinéma, please
12/04/2024, 08:20 - Théodore Bedos: Yes. But apparently he was still considering seeing her out. Not sure it's the best idea but I didn't want to give him advices, I can't relate and he is already going to therapy.
12/04/2024, 08:22 - Théodore Bedos: Also the man is 30, he told me he was scared of the future, bout how long it would take to grow back a relationship to the the point where he can have kids. And he is having a depression. I think even though he knows it's not the best idea to see her, he doesn't want to feel so lonely.
12/04/2024, 21:18 - Théodore Bedos: Adidas release this new model. What do you think about it?

13/04/2024, 00:23 - Gracou: It’s such a difficult position for him to be in
13/04/2024, 00:23 - Gracou: They are interesting for sure - I think they look better on than when you just see them
13/04/2024, 00:24 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
13/04/2024, 00:25 - Gracou: I know they aren’t your favourite but I’ve been thinking about how you told me I need to up my shoe game and I think it’s a good criticism
13/04/2024, 00:26 - Gracou: I’m very used to being in my comfort zone and just wearing white and black shoes, and I think if I wait for ages trying to find a completely perfect fun shoe then I will never find one and won’t rlly get anywhere! So I think these will be good to experiment with!
13/04/2024, 00:26 - Gracou: Worse comes to worse they are a popular shoe in a popular colour so they will probably resell well
13/04/2024, 09:26 - Théodore Bedos: Cool hope you'll enjoy them.
13/04/2024, 11:32 - Gracou: Why is there a full stop
13/04/2024, 11:32 - Gracou: Such a dry response
13/04/2024, 11:56 - Théodore Bedos: You know it doesn't mean anything to me. I just forgot to not put it.
13/04/2024, 11:57 - Théodore Bedos: I knew you would say something like that. I just didn't know what else to say
13/04/2024, 11:57 - Théodore Bedos: I tried to find something else but I couldn't find anything, sorry.
13/04/2024, 12:00 - Théodore Bedos: I do prefer the one I just showed you but I don't dislike the one you bought either. So I genuinely hope you will like them when they arrive. Would you've preferred that I tried to make you buy the other one? 😂😂
13/04/2024, 14:23 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
13/04/2024, 14:23 - Gracou: Nooooo
13/04/2024, 14:23 - Gracou: Why do u do this
13/04/2024, 14:24 - Gracou: Am I handsome as a man
13/04/2024, 14:24 - Gracou: I do prefer the one I just showed you but I don't dislike the one you bought either. So I genuinely hope you will like them when they arrive. - if u had just said that it would have been fine
13/04/2024, 14:25 - Théodore Bedos: Because I downloaded an app to see what I would look like bald. But it didn't work, I would have to pay. But there was free option to change gender so I tried.

14/04/2024, 10:12 - Théodore Bedos: Damn lucky girl, you got a sexy boyfriend!
14/04/2024, 10:12 - Théodore Bedos: The singer of Over the rainbow

19/04/2024, 11:26 - Théodore Bedos: So do you want me to ask Nari and Viktor?
19/04/2024, 13:07 - Gracou: What do you think?
19/04/2024, 13:09 - Théodore Bedos: I can ask them. But as I told you last time we would have to leave when they come back from their party. Otherwise it's rude to force them to stay awake until 3am if they were back at 2am
19/04/2024, 13:09 - Gracou: What are they doing that night?
19/04/2024, 13:13 - Théodore Bedos: I told you they were thinking of going out as well.

24/04/2024, 20:34 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't feel it was so bad. Also I was under the impression that you were alone in your apartment
24/04/2024, 20:34 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't get it, believe me
24/04/2024, 20:34 - Gracou: No my dad came in the room multiple times whilst we were on the phone. I said hi to him.
24/04/2024, 20:35 - Gracou: I don’t have very much charge on my phone and I need to do the dishes before I get told off
24/04/2024, 20:35 - Théodore Bedos: I genuinely thought you were alone from the way you talked about auntie Lisa's priblem

24/04/2024, 20:54 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway. Would you like to tell me by text. Or just not talk about it at all?
24/04/2024, 22:12 - Gracou: I hung up and told u what was going on

28/04/2024, 19:28 - Théodore Bedos: And I just realised I don't have a reserves seat
28/04/2024, 19:30 - Théodore Bedos: I am happy that yours isn't packed. Last time it was difficult to get a seat
28/04/2024, 20:03 - Gracou: Yes it’s a relief to feel I have two seats to myself for the trip :)
28/04/2024, 22:02 - Théodore Bedos: I just made it back home. Did you arrive?
28/04/2024, 22:59 - Théodore Bedos: Are you safe at home?
28/04/2024, 23:03 - Gracou: When I get my ukelele I think I will learn this because it seems quite easy to learn and I can sing this song bc it’s not too high 😄

29/04/2024, 14:15 - Théodore Bedos: I tried again the shoes and I think it's gonna be good. They just need to get shaped.
29/04/2024, 15:18 - Gracou: Yes I am
29/04/2024, 15:18 - Gracou: Last summer
29/04/2024, 15:18 - Gracou: Are you sure? They seemed tight
29/04/2024, 15:29 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I have compared to my other pair from the same brand. It's really the same, it just needs to loosen up.
29/04/2024, 15:29 - Théodore Bedos: I am very excited for them
29/04/2024, 18:37 - Théodore Bedos: I haven't been selected for the champions league final and Jim forgot to apply 😢😢😢😢
29/04/2024, 18:38 - Théodore Bedos: I should have asked my parents and you to put their name in the draft too just in case
29/04/2024, 19:48 - Gracou: That’s good 😁
29/04/2024, 19:48 - Gracou: Oh no ☹️☹️☹️

29/04/2024, 19:52 - Théodore Bedos: He said he would come to Frome to watch it together
29/04/2024, 22:52 - Gracou: Aww at least there is that

29/04/2024, 23:03 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
29/04/2024, 23:08 - Théodore Bedos: Not the most connection on this dance
29/04/2024, 23:09 - Théodore Bedos: Good you might manage to be done by the 25th of May for when we come👍
29/04/2024, 23:10 - Gracou: In the end I said I wouldn’t dance w her anymore bc she is such a selfish dance partner lol

30/04/2024, 09:20 - Théodore Bedos: Rocking my loafers today! No  pain so far. I love them
30/04/2024, 09:20 - Théodore Bedos: I am really glad you made me buy the brown one this summer.
30/04/2024, 09:23 - Théodore Bedos: I think it is much better to have these more relaxed one in black and the brown for the chunky version
30/04/2024, 09:45 - Gracou: Great!
30/04/2024, 09:45 - Gracou: The brown is still my favourite 😊
30/04/2024, 09:48 - Théodore Bedos: Different vibes, I can't wear the brown in summer
30/04/2024, 09:51 - Gracou: Of course you can that’s silly
30/04/2024, 09:51 - Gracou: I don’t see why u think the black ones are casual to me they are so much less casual bc they are so shiny
30/04/2024, 10:16 - Théodore Bedos: Because the black one are derived from boat shoes, obviously. Therefore it makes them a lot more casual and summary
30/04/2024, 10:16 - Théodore Bedos: The brown one are very chunky and not light, which makes them wintery, you silly billy
30/04/2024, 10:24 - Gracou: The texture is more casual and versatile and the colour goes better with softer summery tones than evil dark black

30/04/2024, 15:44 - Théodore Bedos: Because I gave some examples of great summer outfits with this loafers. But I shouldn't try to convince you or debate to much with you. So I stopped
30/04/2024, 15:45 - Théodore Bedos: *But I remembered I shouldn't
30/04/2024, 18:33 - Gracou: No I’m this situation it was humorous especially since u called me silly billy
30/04/2024, 18:33 - Gracou: It was lighthearted
30/04/2024, 18:50 - Théodore Bedos: That's what I thought. But I am struggling to tell. So I didn't risk it

01/05/2024, 22:50 - Théodore Bedos: That's a strange reaction
01/05/2024, 22:51 - Théodore Bedos: I m giving you a compliment
01/05/2024, 23:05 - Gracou: Sorry I meant to say thank you first
01/05/2024, 23:05 - Gracou: But why Natalie Portman?
01/05/2024, 23:12 - Gracou: I Hope you have gotten home safe x
01/05/2024, 23:34 - Théodore Bedos: Because we were saying with Nari that Nathalie Portman was very pretty. And I wanted to let you know that she was a little peanut compared to you
01/05/2024, 23:34 - Théodore Bedos: Not yet, I am still in the train and I keep falling asleep. I am worried I'll miss my stop
02/05/2024, 14:28 - Théodore Bedos: Nari and Viktor are going to Prague this weekend. Nari's dad has a house there, she said she would invite us anytime we want
02/05/2024, 20:33 - Gracou: Erm that sounds awesome
02/05/2024, 20:33 - Gracou: It’s a shame we can’t go with them this weekend

04/05/2024, 11:20 - Théodore Bedos: Also there was this interesting underground entry that seems to be a restaurant. I thought maybe you would like to go
04/05/2024, 11:20 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
04/05/2024, 11:23 - Théodore Bedos: It's actually just a a coffee shop/ brunch

04/05/2024, 11:23 - Théodore Bedos: A bit disappointed, I was expecting more
04/05/2024, 18:52 - Théodore Bedos: Tom asked me to join my car for the trip, and he asked me if my car was big enough for him to bring big tents. He said you asked him. If it's just for sleeping, isn't it simpler to bring sleeping bags and sleep inside?
04/05/2024, 18:52 - Théodore Bedos: Just checking solutions, in case they are too big for my car.
05/05/2024, 13:10 - Théodore Bedos: Happy 3 years and 2 months 😘

05/05/2024, 13:58 - Théodore Bedos: Alright I see
05/05/2024, 13:58 - Théodore Bedos: It's almost in Sheffield you know. That's completely at the North, almost Scotland.

06/05/2024, 20:51 - Théodore Bedos: I have cooked this with the remaining of bottle of wine you left and some lentils I had from when we lived together. It smells delicious 🤤🤤🤤
07/05/2024, 00:58 - Gracou: I have missed you this weekend x
07/05/2024, 00:58 - Gracou: Did it taste good?
07/05/2024, 00:58 - Gracou: Those lentils must be so old omg!
07/05/2024, 08:53 - Théodore Bedos: It tasted very good but I undercooked the lentils a little so I recooked what was left for tomorrow. I think it should be perfect now
07/05/2024, 08:54 - Théodore Bedos: Was it a good weekend?

07/05/2024, 19:32 - Théodore Bedos: I bumped into a girl from volleyball in the bus. We had a nice talk and then she was meeting some other people from volleyball in a bar. I went to say, hi. It was fun to see some familiar faces
07/05/2024, 19:33 - Gracou: That does sound fun :)
07/05/2024, 19:35 - Théodore Bedos: You got to be praying about PSG this evening. We lost 1-0 the first game. We are gonna need all the support in the world
07/05/2024, 19:35 - Gracou: Yay I am looking forward to hearing about it
07/05/2024, 19:35 - Gracou: Enjoy your game x
07/05/2024, 23:58 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
08/05/2024, 00:03 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I am very sad
08/05/2024, 00:03 - Théodore Bedos: We hit the post 6 times!!!! And didn't score once. Destiny wasn't with us
08/05/2024, 00:17 - Théodore Bedos: The last game of Mbappe with Paris before he leaves. What a shame😢
08/05/2024, 00:18 - Théodore Bedos: I had a very nice evening with Will though. The 50min alone on the bus thinking about it were hard though
08/05/2024, 00:28 - Gracou: That’s really unfortunate :(:(
08/05/2024, 00:28 - Gracou: Oh the last one! Wow yes it would have been better to end on a high
08/05/2024, 00:28 - Gracou: Thinking about the loss you mean?
08/05/2024, 08:35 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
08/05/2024, 08:36 - Théodore Bedos: You have been going to bed crazy late recently. Every day you answer me back after midnight. Do you feel tired?
08/05/2024, 10:15 - Gracou: I’m struggling to sleep at the moment :/
08/05/2024, 10:16 - Théodore Bedos: That's annoying
08/05/2024, 10:16 - Théodore Bedos: Are you stressed?
08/05/2024, 10:16 - Théodore Bedos: My guess is that you are lacking of cuddles before going to sleep

11/05/2024, 08:32 - Théodore Bedos: Why would it be ? 🤨
11/05/2024, 08:33 - Théodore Bedos: Don't you think it looks fancy?
11/05/2024, 11:27 - Gracou: Because it isn’t a new bed it’s the bed that used to be in my room in Devon 😂😂
11/05/2024, 12:24 - Théodore Bedos: Oh I forgot about it
11/05/2024, 12:24 - Théodore Bedos: I think it looks fancy

12/05/2024, 01:52 - Gracou: A disposable camera
12/05/2024, 01:52 - Gracou: I’ve stopped using them recently but it’s quite nice to look back on the photos, maybe I will start again
12/05/2024, 01:53 - Gracou: Why is he so much smaller than everyone 😁
12/05/2024, 01:53 - Gracou: I am so exhausted babe 😩
12/05/2024, 01:54 - Gracou: It is very tiring trying to set up a whole house and also clean the whole house bc of the dust made by building work whilst also going through all your belongings, organising them, getting rid of stuff you don’t need and then also trying to plan all the furniture and appliances you need to buy while also trying to make it seem interior designed
12/05/2024, 01:54 - Gracou: It’s a lot!
12/05/2024, 08:41 - Théodore Bedos: He isn't. That's just the angle
12/05/2024, 08:42 - Théodore Bedos: Seems very exhausting.
12/05/2024, 08:43 - Théodore Bedos: You refused my helped when I offered to come help you though.... 🙄
12/05/2024, 08:44 - Théodore Bedos: You know you don't have to make everything look interior designed in the first place. You are not renting it just now. It's fine to just progressively make it look better over time.
12/05/2024, 08:45 - Théodore Bedos: It's not a big deal if you have a cardboard box table for a month for example
12/05/2024, 08:46 - Théodore Bedos: Until you find the one you like at a good price

12/05/2024, 12:28 - Gracou: And I think it would be difficult for you to help - although I’m buying some ikea furniture today that it would be good to have my little engineer to make
12/05/2024, 12:29 - Gracou: Yes I just don’t like waste so where possible I would prefer to buy the right thing the first time
12/05/2024, 12:29 - Gracou: The stuff I’m not sure about I will live without for now

12/05/2024, 20:06 - Théodore Bedos: You already had one
12/05/2024, 20:06 - Théodore Bedos: I can't believe there was 2 in there
12/05/2024, 20:07 - Théodore Bedos: You said it, I remember. You got one and the you said, there could be another one.
12/05/2024, 20:07 - Théodore Bedos: I went to the doctor 2 weeks ago and she couldn't tell if there was one
12/05/2024, 20:53 - Théodore Bedos: null
12/05/2024, 22:28 - Théodore Bedos: Are you sleeping at your new place tonight?
12/05/2024, 22:55 - Gracou: Hi babe sorry for not taking ur call I’ve been at it all day with the flat and when u called I was in focus mode trying to sort curtains
12/05/2024, 22:55 - Gracou: No I’m sleeping at my parents again 😂
12/05/2024, 22:56 - Gracou: I want them all 😤😤
12/05/2024, 22:56 - Gracou: 😁
12/05/2024, 22:56 - Gracou: Does this mean I’m better than the doctor🧐
12/05/2024, 23:09 - Théodore Bedos: Better instinct apparently
12/05/2024, 23:09 - Théodore Bedos: I assumed that's what it was
12/05/2024, 23:10 - Théodore Bedos: Will you be done soon? Fo you have much left to do?
12/05/2024, 23:10 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to bed. Love you ❤️

12/05/2024, 23:18 - Gracou: Yes hahaha
12/05/2024, 23:18 - Gracou: I have lots left to do!
12/05/2024, 23:18 - Gracou: Tomorrow I am focusing on getting curtains and also breakfast bar stools because then there will actually be somewhere to sit and eat
12/05/2024, 23:18 - Gracou: I also need to get a kettle and a microwave
12/05/2024, 23:19 - Gracou: I love you too x
13/05/2024, 09:25 - Théodore Bedos: Getting a breakfast bar and tools seem expensive 🫰 how much do you think it'll cost?
13/05/2024, 09:29 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
13/05/2024, 09:29 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
13/05/2024, 09:29 - Théodore Bedos: In Lidl
13/05/2024, 09:29 - Théodore Bedos: 60£ microwave and 30£ kettle
13/05/2024, 09:29 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

13/05/2024, 09:32 - Théodore Bedos: Looking good 👍
13/05/2024, 09:33 - Théodore Bedos: Wow 100£ for the microwave! Does it always cost that much? I have never bought any

13/05/2024, 09:35 - Gracou: The kettle and toaster together was £50
13/05/2024, 09:35 - Gracou: So not bad
13/05/2024, 09:35 - Théodore Bedos: Nice
13/05/2024, 09:35 - Gracou: I tried to find ones that where inexpensive but also looked nice and weren’t compromising on function
13/05/2024, 09:37 - Théodore Bedos: Good job
13/05/2024, 09:37 - Théodore Bedos: Do you see my sleeveless army jacket that had a lot of strings coming off?
13/05/2024, 09:38 - Théodore Bedos: I went to bath tailor last year with it and he said it would cost me 50. I have it to a guy in Trowbridge and he charged me 20. I just got it back, and it's back to new
13/05/2024, 09:39 - Théodore Bedos: I am very happy. The tailor in Trowbridge is super nice and really good. I have him some other stuffs before and it was super cheap
13/05/2024, 13:17 - Gracou: Yay that’s great
13/05/2024, 13:17 - Gracou: It’s interesting that it’s a man
13/05/2024, 13:25 - Théodore Bedos: It was a man in Bath too
13/05/2024, 17:07 - Gracou: Babe I was just thinking and Lolly has been talking about doing a surf day for a while and we were trying to plan a trip w some friends in wales or whatever
13/05/2024, 17:07 - Gracou: But actually I think it would be nicer to just have a few people in Devon
13/05/2024, 17:07 - Gracou: And obviously I thought of you since you can apparently surf but I’ve never seen it
13/05/2024, 17:07 - Gracou: Would you find that fun?
13/05/2024, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: Yes of course, I would love it. I haven't surfed in a while though but it should come back.
13/05/2024, 17:19 - Théodore Bedos: I asked you about the Wales trip but you said you were not planning it anymore.
13/05/2024, 18:24 - Théodore Bedos: When would it be?
13/05/2024, 20:15 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>

13/05/2024, 23:09 - Théodore Bedos: Absolute non sense
13/05/2024, 23:10 - Théodore Bedos: Don't see why you would want anything else than bin bags
13/05/2024, 23:11 - Gracou: 😁😁😁
13/05/2024, 23:11 - Gracou: It’s a bit up and down
13/05/2024, 23:11 - Gracou: I probs won’t pick a date until after the 25th weekend
13/05/2024, 23:29 - Théodore Bedos: I really recommend you to watch Frieren on Crunchyroll. There are 28 episodes. It's a very nice anime, it's very calme and agreable. It makes you feel good at the end of every episode. The animation is great too. There are few fight scenes so you don't see it but when it's needed it's great.
13/05/2024, 23:35 - Théodore Bedos: It's about an elfe who went on 10 years quest with 3 other adventurers to kill the demon king. And because elfs can live millenniums, when she sees her friends again they are very old and she had not realised that time had passed for them. So when one of them dies she realise that she never got to know him because she never payed attention to life. 
It makes you think about the meaning of life, the ways to be remembered and many other things. It's great 👍

14/05/2024, 22:29 - Gracou: :(:(
14/05/2024, 22:29 - Gracou: The pressure is on
14/05/2024, 23:10 - Théodore Bedos: I just made the choice to buy vegan protein powder instead of normal milk protein powder.
14/05/2024, 23:13 - Théodore Bedos: Vegan protein is normally not as complete as milk protein, but as I am milk intolerant, it may be that I am not fully digesting the milk protein anyway. So I am gonna test for 2 month with veg a powder and see if I feel a change or not. It's also half the price of normal protein, so if it's good for me, it would also be great for my wallet.
14/05/2024, 23:13 - Théodore Bedos: Interesting experiment in my opinion
14/05/2024, 23:32 - Gracou: Yes that sounds good
14/05/2024, 23:32 - Gracou: And great for your farts

18/05/2024, 12:00 - Théodore Bedos: Can we do salmon and a Mediterranean veggie mix?
18/05/2024, 12:00 - Gracou: No we don’t have to it’s just I thought it might save some time

20/05/2024, 22:30 - Théodore Bedos: It was a bit sad being in your home on a sunny day but without you.
20/05/2024, 22:31 - Théodore Bedos: I felt the weekend went very fast. I am glad I get to see you soon
21/05/2024, 09:50 - Gracou: Oh no

22/05/2024, 19:31 - Gracou: null
22/05/2024, 20:06 - Théodore Bedos: You have all the reasons to be annoyed at me and you can be. I just hope that you know that I thought about you all day even though for some reason I didn't connect it with your birthday, and that you'll forgive me.
22/05/2024, 22:02 - Gracou: To be honest, if you had just said ‘oh no I’m so sorry’ when I told you then I would have said don’t worry about it but it was that you just laughed it off made me feel like u didn’t think it mattered and didn’t care which I do find hurtful
22/05/2024, 22:40 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry I reacted this way. I laughed at myself for being so forgetful, I am really ashamed.

23/05/2024, 16:59 - Théodore Bedos: Yesterday I had a bit of fever, today seems better.
23/05/2024, 17:00 - Théodore Bedos: I tested for covid, I didn't have it
23/05/2024, 17:01 - Gracou: I feel bad but it’s because I have been breathing some fumes
23/05/2024, 17:06 - Théodore Bedos: Why did you breath some fumes?
23/05/2024, 17:07 - Théodore Bedos: I just got my car back from the garage. They have fixed my seatbelt issue, I can have 4 passengers now. So we are good for this weekend
23/05/2024, 18:55 - Théodore Bedos: What's your address, please?

27/05/2024, 21:29 - Théodore Bedos: I just arrived home
27/05/2024, 21:32 - Théodore Bedos: There was still no toilet paper, so I asked Callum why he wouldn't buy toilet paper. He said a angry "ok" and left. So I said, why do you leave? That's a strange reaction. He said angrily because it feels like an attack. I said, no it's not, I asked you nicely, I am confirming now that there was no bad feeling. And he left again.
27/05/2024, 21:34 - Théodore Bedos: What's going on, every time I ask you or tell you anything you seem to take it like I want to start a fight. I should be allowed to ask you why you haven't bought new toilet paper, without you taking it like an attack.
27/05/2024, 21:35 - Théodore Bedos: He said he had lots of things going on. But he doesn't seem like it's a resolved subject.
27/05/2024, 21:37 - Théodore Bedos: I have never seen somehow with that little ability to communicate
27/05/2024, 21:47 - Gracou: He doesn’t have many adult relationships so he has no practice probably 🤷‍♀️
27/05/2024, 21:55 - Théodore Bedos: I forgot to let you hero realms
27/05/2024, 21:55 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry

12/06/2024, 20:42 - Théodore Bedos: I am surprised that you chose an open one. You told me you wanted a closed one

14/06/2024, 11:48 - Théodore Bedos: Looks like it's made for you
14/06/2024, 11:48 - Théodore Bedos: The pattern to help you cut is exactly the way you like to cut pizzas
14/06/2024, 11:57 - Gracou: No the slices are too big!
14/06/2024, 11:57 - Gracou: But close :)
14/06/2024, 12:08 - Théodore Bedos: Babe it is 6 slices, it can't be too big
14/06/2024, 12:09 - Théodore Bedos: It's proportional to the size of the pizza 😂😂😂
14/06/2024, 12:11 - Théodore Bedos: If you cut you pizza in 6 even slices, the slice will be the exact same size if you use a board or if you use nothing
14/06/2024, 12:12 - Gracou: But in the picture it looks like the pizza slices are very wide
14/06/2024, 12:12 - Théodore Bedos: I agree but it's just picture
14/06/2024, 12:13 - Théodore Bedos: Optical illusion
14/06/2024, 12:13 - Théodore Bedos: Anyway, the price was 4£
14/06/2024, 15:22 - Théodore Bedos: I just learned that Marielle the wife of Jean Yves had a stroke. And now she can't speak, write or read.
14/06/2024, 15:22 - Gracou: Oh goodness
14/06/2024, 15:23 - Gracou: I never knew that was how jean yves was spelled
14/06/2024, 15:23 - Gracou: I thought it was Genieve
14/06/2024, 15:23 - Gracou: Can she walk and move?
14/06/2024, 15:23 - Théodore Bedos: She can understand and make sounds but it's like a foreign language.
14/06/2024, 15:23 - Gracou: Also this is manas friend that sometimes comes to the south right?
14/06/2024, 15:23 - Théodore Bedos: Yes she can walk
14/06/2024, 15:23 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
14/06/2024, 15:23 - Théodore Bedos: My grandparents best friends
14/06/2024, 15:23 - Gracou: Wow that’s unusual normally stories effect peoples ability to walk
14/06/2024, 15:23 - Théodore Bedos: A bit like grandparents to me
14/06/2024, 15:24 - Gracou: Do you feel okay about it?
14/06/2024, 15:24 - Gracou: Do the doctors think she can learn to speak again?
14/06/2024, 15:24 - Gracou: It is crazy that she has forgotten to read that will be harder than speaking to relearn
14/06/2024, 15:24 - Gracou: I would be so sad if I forgot how to read
14/06/2024, 15:25 - Théodore Bedos: I am ok. She can recover apparently but it can take a year
14/06/2024, 15:25 - Théodore Bedos: I just called Jean Yves to take news and he sounded fine mentally
14/06/2024, 15:25 - Gracou: That’s good
14/06/2024, 15:27 - Théodore Bedos: It's so sad, she is such a nice person to chat with.
14/06/2024, 15:28 - Gracou: Yes she’s lovely
14/06/2024, 15:28 - Gracou: I am sure that jean yves will help her to recover well

15/06/2024, 11:57 - Théodore Bedos: Don't forget to take your pan that you can't use

16/06/2024, 20:47 - Gracou: And woke up drunk today and felt so poorly that I didn’t think it was safe tk drive
16/06/2024, 20:47 - Gracou: So I’m currently at my house in Devon with Eric and I’m going to pick up my car and go to cornwall tomorrow
16/06/2024, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: How come?
16/06/2024, 20:49 - Théodore Bedos: Remind me who is Eric?
16/06/2024, 20:49 - Gracou: <Médias omis>

16/06/2024, 20:51 - Gracou: How are you feeling about your presentation on Tuesday? X
16/06/2024, 20:51 - Théodore Bedos: Why did you bring him to your house in Devon? Where is your car? How did you go to your house without your car?
16/06/2024, 20:52 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, it's okay
16/06/2024, 20:52 - Gracou: A because I didn’t feel safe to drive today as I said
16/06/2024, 20:53 - Gracou: So I needed to sleep somewhere
16/06/2024, 20:53 - Gracou: So Eric agreed to drive me to my house and then tomorrow he will drive me back to my car at toms house
16/06/2024, 20:53 - Gracou: Which is inconvenient bc toms house is 50 mins away
16/06/2024, 20:54 - Gracou: But I didn’t feel comfortable asking to stay at toms
16/06/2024, 20:54 - Théodore Bedos: Nice of him
16/06/2024, 20:54 - Gracou: Yes
16/06/2024, 20:54 - Théodore Bedos: I was gonna ask why you didn't just stay at Tom's
16/06/2024, 20:54 - Gracou: He is going to his parents house in Plymouth after
16/06/2024, 20:54 - Gracou: Yeah I didn’t feel I could ask
16/06/2024, 20:54 - Gracou: I thought it would be very rude
16/06/2024, 20:55 - Théodore Bedos: How was the party?
16/06/2024, 20:58 - Gracou: Well I arrived so late and then spent 2 hours talking to bea in the toilet so I basically missed the whole thing
16/06/2024, 20:58 - Théodore Bedos: Oh that sucks
16/06/2024, 20:58 - Théodore Bedos: Was it worth it talking to Bea?
16/06/2024, 20:59 - Théodore Bedos: What did you get out of it?
16/06/2024, 20:59 - Gracou: Yes and no
16/06/2024, 21:00 - Théodore Bedos: Seems like someone should have accepted the offer to take a little road break Friday evening in Frome to arrive fresh at the party on Saturday 🙄
16/06/2024, 21:00 - Théodore Bedos: Tell me
16/06/2024, 21:03 - Gracou: I cant type it out right now because I’m with Eric.
16/06/2024, 21:03 - Gracou: X*

19/06/2024, 12:09 - Théodore Bedos: Ahaha, that's good 👍
19/06/2024, 19:51 - Gracou: I got a new flatmate today!
19/06/2024, 19:57 - Théodore Bedos: Wow tell me about him
19/06/2024, 20:03 - Gracou: It’s a girl who is my age and a pharmasist :)
20/06/2024, 00:36 - Théodore Bedos: Nice 👍👍👍
20/06/2024, 00:36 - Théodore Bedos: How much is she paying? How did you find her? Have you conducted an interview?
20/06/2024, 08:32 - Gracou: I found her on spare room and yes i have conducted an interview :)
20/06/2024, 08:32 - Gracou: to be honest I am a bit annoyed at myself because I went below the price I really wanted and I am actually sure she was basically bluffing with me and would have gone to the price I actually wante
20/06/2024, 08:33 - Gracou: but she is going to pay £580 a month
20/06/2024, 08:33 - Gracou: I really wanted £600 and i think she would have paid that
20/06/2024, 08:34 - Gracou: so im sort of annoyed at myself :/ i feel like I should have just trusted that my apartment was better than the others she looked at becuase it is
20/06/2024, 08:40 - Théodore Bedos: Did she ask for 580?
20/06/2024, 08:41 - Théodore Bedos: Can you decide when she leaves? Or is there a minimum of X years?
20/06/2024, 08:41 - Théodore Bedos: X months I meant
20/06/2024, 08:41 - Gracou: she plans to live there for 12 months and i have said thats fine
20/06/2024, 08:42 - Gracou: well she basically said to me that the others that she looked at where £600 (and mine was higher)
20/06/2024, 08:42 - Gracou: and so I told her that i would be willing to match it at £600. and i should have just stayed at that point because she would have agreed
20/06/2024, 08:43 - Gracou: but then she said 580 and i said if its the difference between you coming and not coming then I can do that (because i think she is a really good choice as a flatmate)
20/06/2024, 08:43 - Gracou: but yeah i am angry because I am certain it was a bluff and she would have done £600
20/06/2024, 08:56 - Théodore Bedos: It's okay babe it's not such a big difference. If she is clean and nice it's worth a lot more than 20/month
20/06/2024, 08:57 - Théodore Bedos: I would pay extra 20 per month to have clean flatmates
20/06/2024, 08:58 - Gracou: :/
20/06/2024, 08:58 - Gracou: I would use the extra £20 to pay for a cleaner 😂
20/06/2024, 09:00 - Théodore Bedos: It's worth more than that
20/06/2024, 09:00 - Théodore Bedos: Don't stress I would have done the same
20/06/2024, 09:01 - Gracou: Thanks babe
20/06/2024, 09:01 - Gracou: I think I would also like to be able to say to people £600 when they ask rather than £580
20/06/2024, 09:01 - Gracou: I know it’s silly to care
20/06/2024, 15:06 - Théodore Bedos: You are learning babe, next time you'll say no and maybe you'll lose the candidate and the one time after you'll be able to get it right
20/06/2024, 15:06 - Théodore Bedos: Not silly
20/06/2024, 15:08 - Théodore Bedos: My thing is finishing earlier on Friday than I thought, I can be home by 6:40pm

21/06/2024, 18:01 - Théodore Bedos: I m at the change at Westbury and my train has been delayed by 30min. You can pick me up in Westbury if you want, it's not far
21/06/2024, 18:02 - Gracou: It’s 20 minutes from where I am

23/06/2024, 22:03 - Théodore Bedos: Don't forget to ask Darcy if I can come to her graduation and when we would need to be there. I have found tickets from London to Warwick for 25£ with return and it would cost £30 to change my Eurostar tickets, so I could do that.
23/06/2024, 22:51 - Théodore Bedos: Are you home?

25/06/2024, 21:51 - Théodore Bedos: I think I would never put the belt that are at the back, back on it.

27/06/2024, 17:10 - Théodore Bedos: Alright 👍
27/06/2024, 17:11 - Théodore Bedos: Do you have more details about this?
27/06/2024, 17:57 - Théodore Bedos: Because to decide what Eurostar ticket to get we need to know if we go to Bernieres to make the train match but going to Bernieres depends on when you need to be in the south

10/07/2024, 23:30 - Gracou: Was this the pink chair you sent me? https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeG3rnnk/
10/07/2024, 23:30 - Gracou: Was this the pink chair you sent me? https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeG3rnnk/
10/07/2024, 23:30 - Gracou: Read maybe x
11/07/2024, 04:48 - Théodore Bedos: Can't watch it without the app
11/07/2024, 04:49 - Théodore Bedos: But it seems to be about the velvet chair I found for you
11/07/2024, 05:58 - Théodore Bedos: Had to wake at 4:30 to do my induction with the big truck drivers today, starting at 5:15am
11/07/2024, 05:58 - Théodore Bedos: Spending the day in a mega truck
11/07/2024, 05:58 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
11/07/2024, 07:21 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
11/07/2024, 07:22 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
11/07/2024, 08:03 - Gracou: It’s quite nice
11/07/2024, 08:38 - Théodore Bedos: Are you going to buy it?
11/07/2024, 09:14 - Théodore Bedos: Do you like my new shoes?
11/07/2024, 09:14 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
11/07/2024, 10:15 - Gracou: Stunning
11/07/2024, 11:23 - Théodore Bedos: My driver from Lithuania thought I was Bulgarian
11/07/2024, 11:23 - Gracou: That’s a new low
11/07/2024, 20:16 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
11/07/2024, 20:16 - Gracou: Niamh put this up in my living room :(
11/07/2024, 21:08 - Théodore Bedos: 😂😂😂
11/07/2024, 21:08 - Gracou: What do I dooooooo!!!
11/07/2024, 21:08 - Théodore Bedos: Does she have a child?
11/07/2024, 21:09 - Gracou: No she painted it last year apparently
11/07/2024, 21:09 - Gracou: She literally said it’s bad so why did she put it up when I left
11/07/2024, 21:12 - Théodore Bedos: I think you've got to let it go. It was inevitable from the moment you agreed to rent this room. It's not just your apartment anymore.
11/07/2024, 21:13 - Théodore Bedos: It's not a huge room she has, you can't expect her to have her whole life in 5m2
11/07/2024, 21:14 - Théodore Bedos: You can try to bring it up nicely that you don't like this one. But if it's not that it will be something else
11/07/2024, 21:15 - Gracou: No I don’t agree, the people that have lived with my aunt keep decorations in their room
11/07/2024, 21:15 - Gracou: It’s not like a normal tenancy
11/07/2024, 21:15 - Gracou: It is reasonable that she keeps her belongings either in her room or in the cupboard I gave her
11/07/2024, 21:16 - Théodore Bedos: Was it clear from when you agreed on the deal?
11/07/2024, 21:17 - Gracou: Well it is written that she is renting the room only and then basically has access to the communal spaces
11/07/2024, 21:18 - Théodore Bedos: Then if you are confident about it, tell her and make it clear
11/07/2024, 21:18 - Théodore Bedos: If I would have been leaving with you. Would you have let me put my mangas on the shelves?
11/07/2024, 21:19 - Gracou: Even when I lived with friends at Uni we didn’t put our decorations in the living room or communal areas
11/07/2024, 21:20 - Gracou: Living with you was the first time I did that
11/07/2024, 21:29 - Théodore Bedos: Go on
11/07/2024, 21:29 - Gracou: I’m just going to think about it
11/07/2024, 21:31 - Gracou: I JUST GOT SPOILED FOR GOT AGAINNNNNNN
11/07/2024, 21:32 - Théodore Bedos: Ohhhh poor you
11/07/2024, 22:39 - Théodore Bedos: Goodnight my love
12/07/2024, 03:18 - Gracou: SPOILED AGAINNNN
12/07/2024, 03:18 - Gracou: I don’t think I can go on the internet anymore
12/07/2024, 03:18 - Gracou: Goodnight babe x I just finished packing for our holiday 💖
12/07/2024, 08:16 - Théodore Bedos: Woowwwww good job babe  🏆🏆🏆
12/07/2024, 08:16 - Théodore Bedos: Did you take sport shoes
12/07/2024, 08:18 - Gracou: I’ve just taken the shoes that you bought me that are Nikes ones and I’m thinking of using them for sports
12/07/2024, 08:39 - Théodore Bedos: There will be a little hike to go in the calanques and if we do rafting in the gorges du Verdon you'll need shoes to wear in the water. So I would take a pair that you care less about
12/07/2024, 08:45 - Gracou: Okay 👍🤗
12/07/2024, 09:53 - Théodore Bedos: I had already told you, but Clint officially confirmed it to me today and sent me this
12/07/2024, 09:53 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
12/07/2024, 10:27 - Gracou: here are some of the amazon prime day deals if you are interested: https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-prime-day-2024-deals-preview?utm_source=amazonnewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=071124&utm_term=primepreviewdeals2024

12/07/2024, 10:28 - Gracou: gunna have to work harder to keep up with your salary increases :D:D
12/07/2024, 11:08 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks
12/07/2024, 11:09 - Théodore Bedos: You or Me?
12/07/2024, 11:10 - Théodore Bedos: Because Clint told me that he almost never gave the top salary raise to someone. So I am a bit worried I can't get it in 6 months
12/07/2024, 11:19 - Gracou: Me 😂
12/07/2024, 11:19 - Gracou: What do you mean?
12/07/2024, 11:21 - Théodore Bedos: He said that he has really really hight standards for giving the top raise. So it's gonna be difficult to do as well in the next 6 months to get the max raise again.
12/07/2024, 11:21 - Théodore Bedos: So need to work harder because now he probably raises his expectations
12/07/2024, 11:21 - Gracou: I see what you mean
12/07/2024, 11:22 - Gracou: What’s the next raise amount?
12/07/2024, 11:22 - Théodore Bedos: Same, 0, 1250 or 2500
12/07/2024, 11:22 - Gracou: Btw it was the burger at the weekend that upset our tummies
12/07/2024, 11:22 - Gracou: The potatoes and the other burger were fine
12/07/2024, 11:23 - Gracou: Nice you would be at £35k
12/07/2024, 11:23 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
12/07/2024, 11:23 - Gracou: U might be the new Gary
12/07/2024, 11:23 - Gracou: 😂
12/07/2024, 11:23 - Théodore Bedos: Good job detective
12/07/2024, 12:42 - Gracou: Fanks
12/07/2024, 12:43 - Gracou: Are we staying at nari and Viktor’s when we get back from warrick?
12/07/2024, 12:48 - Théodore Bedos: I can ask if you want
12/07/2024, 12:48 - Théodore Bedos: Are we staying before?
12/07/2024, 12:48 - Gracou: Yes I thought we were staying from Friday x
12/07/2024, 12:49 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, I am going to ask them
12/07/2024, 12:52 - Théodore Bedos: One of their kitten just died
12/07/2024, 13:20 - Gracou: Like you! https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGetF1Eyk/
12/07/2024, 13:38 - Gracou: Oh my goodness what happened
12/07/2024, 13:50 - Théodore Bedos: One was smaller than the other, struggled to eat and never got much bigger.
12/07/2024, 13:50 - Théodore Bedos: They came back from dinner yesterday evening and she was dead when they arrived
12/07/2024, 13:51 - Théodore Bedos: They buried her in the garden
12/07/2024, 13:51 - Théodore Bedos: Can't see the video, don't have tiktok
12/07/2024, 13:51 - Gracou: That’s devastating
12/07/2024, 13:51 - Gracou: U can wtach it online
12/07/2024, 13:52 - Gracou: Is it the grey one?
12/07/2024, 13:52 - Théodore Bedos: Nope, not letting me
12/07/2024, 13:52 - Théodore Bedos: I think the little black one
12/07/2024, 15:57 - Gracou: Aw
12/07/2024, 15:58 - Gracou: Do you think I should put Niamh’s deposit in a Revolut savings account?
12/07/2024, 16:05 - Théodore Bedos: Tandem
12/07/2024, 16:05 - Théodore Bedos: It's 5%
12/07/2024, 16:07 - Théodore Bedos: And you can have multiple pots, so like this you can use the 5% for another type of saving and not mix it up with her deposit
12/07/2024, 20:23 - Théodore Bedos: Miss you
13/07/2024, 02:33 - Gracou: I think you can have pots on Revolut
13/07/2024, 02:33 - Gracou: Sleep well darling xoxo
13/07/2024, 08:18 - Théodore Bedos: Yes but it's 3% interest babe
13/07/2024, 09:09 - Théodore Bedos: You don't need a card for tandem, and your money is protected the same.
13/07/2024, 17:42 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
13/07/2024, 17:42 - Théodore Bedos: Do you like this? If you change the cover of the pillow
13/07/2024, 17:45 - Gracou: Ours pretty big I’m a little bit not sure bc it’s leather
13/07/2024, 17:45 - Gracou: How much is it?
13/07/2024, 17:46 - Théodore Bedos: Don't know, it was closed
13/07/2024, 17:46 - Théodore Bedos: Where would you have it?
13/07/2024, 18:17 - Gracou: Well I need something for the living room but it’s not exactly the style I was going for x
13/07/2024, 20:34 - Théodore Bedos: Alright, I am not going to go ask the price then
13/07/2024, 20:35 - Théodore Bedos: God My hero academia season 1 and 2 were amazing 🥹
13/07/2024, 20:35 - Théodore Bedos: I just heard the soundtrack and it made me feel very nostalgic of it
14/07/2024, 02:29 - Gracou: But it’s not quite the right style babe x
14/07/2024, 02:29 - Gracou: Awwww
14/07/2024, 02:29 - Gracou: It was very good I agree
14/07/2024, 08:46 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I get it, that's why I said I am not going back to ask the price
14/07/2024, 08:47 - Théodore Bedos: How is the boating going?

14/07/2024, 18:02 - Théodore Bedos: Are you going to watch the game or will you be in the train?
14/07/2024, 18:17 - Gracou: I won’t watch x
14/07/2024, 18:22 - Théodore Bedos: You might get the emptiest train ever
14/07/2024, 21:07 - Gracou: I think I’m going to go back first thing in the morning x
14/07/2024, 21:08 - Théodore Bedos: You might get the busiest train ever
14/07/2024, 21:09 - Théodore Bedos: How come are you not watching the game if you are staying
14/07/2024, 22:16 - Théodore Bedos: 😢
14/07/2024, 22:19 - Gracou: Not the best outcome
14/07/2024, 22:44 - Gracou: Happy France day by the way!
14/07/2024, 22:52 - Théodore Bedos: I did not even realise!!!

14/07/2024, 22:52 - Théodore Bedos: I didn't watch the walk!
14/07/2024, 23:21 - Gracou: Oh no!

15/07/2024, 10:21 - Gracou: When are you arriving in london this weekend?
15/07/2024, 10:26 - Théodore Bedos: I miss you too
15/07/2024, 10:26 - Théodore Bedos: I arrive Friday evening around 6/7pm I think
15/07/2024, 10:27 - Théodore Bedos: I have checked with Nari and Viktor and we can stay at their place. But nari would be working Saturday and Sunday
15/07/2024, 10:27 - Gracou: Oh we can’t hang out?
15/07/2024, 10:28 - Théodore Bedos: We can in the evening
15/07/2024, 10:28 - Gracou: I have had to cancel on something with joe this week so I was hoping u could hang out w Viktor for a little bit while I meet up w joe?
15/07/2024, 10:28 - Théodore Bedos: Sure
15/07/2024, 10:37 - Gracou: Nice 😁
15/07/2024, 10:37 - Gracou: I’m going to have a crazy week
15/07/2024, 10:37 - Théodore Bedos: Tell me
15/07/2024, 10:40 - Gracou: I had hoped to work from London this week, but I spoke with my dad about it and he told me to be in the office. i was intending to get a train at 8:30 today so I would be in the office for lunch, so I left emelias and came into london. then I entirely slept through my alarm, just didnt hear the noise at all. So now I have lost the money of the ticket and will go this evening. But i need to be back in london on wednesday evening for a royal warrant event that has been booked for ages. to then go back to warrington on thursday morning. Then i will come back on friday evening
15/07/2024, 10:41 - Gracou: 💀
15/07/2024, 10:42 - Théodore Bedos: Wtf! And did you tell your dad all that?
15/07/2024, 10:42 - Gracou: yep he said to just not go to the one on wednesday
15/07/2024, 10:42 - Gracou: but its been booked and i invited adam jarvstrom ages ago. it was my mum that encouraged me to do it
15/07/2024, 10:44 - Théodore Bedos: I would be quiet annoyed at my manager if he made me do that
15/07/2024, 10:45 - Gracou: he says its not possible at the moment for me to not be in the office for a month straight
15/07/2024, 10:45 - Gracou: it is a little annoying though when joe cai is allowed to work in london
15/07/2024, 10:45 - Théodore Bedos: You are in holiday!!
15/07/2024, 10:45 - Théodore Bedos: You re not working from Thailand for a month
15/07/2024, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: I guess he doesn't think he can loose you
15/07/2024, 10:46 - Gracou: yeah but he thinks he is going to make people redundant this week and thinks it doesnt look good if im not coming in to work and seeming lazy when other people are being made redundant
15/07/2024, 10:46 - Gracou: you mean that i wont leave?
15/07/2024, 10:46 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
15/07/2024, 10:47 - Gracou: idk. the business is really bad at the moment
15/07/2024, 10:48 - Gracou: but its a bit annoying and quite an expensive decision :D
15/07/2024, 10:48 - Gracou: but dont worry i wont let it effect our holiday x
15/07/2024, 10:50 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks babe. Is it gonna be okay if you have to pay for many more trains?
15/07/2024, 10:51 - Gracou: I Will manage
15/07/2024, 10:52 - Théodore Bedos: Well let me know if there is a date you need to change or something I can do
15/07/2024, 10:52 - Gracou: I don’t want to be the type of person to cancel 2 days before an event that we have had planned since the begining of June
15/07/2024, 10:52 - Gracou: So I feel I should do the Wednesday thing
15/07/2024, 10:52 - Gracou: What do you mean?
15/07/2024, 10:53 - Théodore Bedos: Like if you want to go to Warwick straight from Warrington and not come to London this week end
15/07/2024, 10:54 - Théodore Bedos: That's very noble of you, but I am sure Adam would be able to understand that if you need to.
15/07/2024, 10:54 - Gracou: I think I will just go through with our plan as I don’t want it to effect our holiday x
15/07/2024, 14:07 - Gracou: Can I hang out w joe on Saturday and leave u and vic?
15/07/2024, 14:08 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah sure 👍
15/07/2024, 14:08 - Théodore Bedos: I think he wants to go play volleyball in a park on 1 day so I can do that.
15/07/2024, 16:45 - Gracou: Perfect 😁😁
15/07/2024, 16:47 - Théodore Bedos: I am surprised you don't say that you would have like to play. Apparently you are a pro at volleyball now
15/07/2024, 16:48 - Gracou: I would like to but I’m not going to stop u from playing with your friend
15/07/2024, 16:48 - Gracou: Especially since it’s ur solution to me being busy
15/07/2024, 19:56 - Théodore Bedos: Hey it's not a problem if you want to see Jo even if I don't have another obvious option like that. It's your holiday too
15/07/2024, 19:56 - Théodore Bedos: And if you really want to play, we can ask Viktor to go on the other day when you are free
15/07/2024, 19:57 - Gracou: It’s up to you darling
15/07/2024, 20:00 - Théodore Bedos: Alright 😘

19/07/2024, 08:35 - Gracou: It’s what u say to a mate
19/07/2024, 09:05 - Théodore Bedos: Ohhh ok
19/07/2024, 09:06 - Théodore Bedos: Is it okay when someone holds the door for you at work?
19/07/2024, 13:11 - Gracou: Yes u can say cheers then
19/07/2024, 13:12 - Gracou: But it’s slightly weird since ur not English but u can get away w it

20/07/2024, 22:08 - Théodore Bedos: null
20/07/2024, 22:50 - Gracou: Im having dinner here it is nearly ready x
20/07/2024, 22:51 - Gracou: If u think it will be bad for nari do u think I should sleep on the sofa here or at adams maybe?
20/07/2024, 22:54 - Théodore Bedos: I asked Nari, it's fine. Just come when you are done
20/07/2024, 22:58 - Gracou: Okay nice 😁

21/07/2024, 01:15 - Gracou: I think it makes more sense than going to naris then going to adams tomorrow which is the opposite direction

25/07/2024, 22:23 - Théodore Bedos: Don't start to think that or you won't sleep. It's just that you have never slept on a train
25/07/2024, 22:39 - Gracou: :/ x
26/07/2024, 06:54 - Gracou: Darling in order to go to Lyon by train I have to go all the way south and then go back up again
26/07/2024, 06:54 - Gracou: Valence is a little bit more possible it’s about 3hrs
26/07/2024, 07:21 - Théodore Bedos: You can just go to Lyon through Valence. But anyway, if it's not direct then it's not worth it. Just go to Valence or Grenoble
26/07/2024, 07:21 - Théodore Bedos: It's 2h30
26/07/2024, 07:21 - Théodore Bedos: Have you arrived?
26/07/2024, 07:32 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/07/2024, 07:33 - Théodore Bedos: There is only one train left to Valence, but it arrives early. You would have to wait for me
26/07/2024, 07:33 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/07/2024, 07:33 - Gracou: I’m here I’m just about to go back to sleep x
26/07/2024, 07:34 - Théodore Bedos: Or you can take the one that arrives at 2:32pm to Grenoble, but we would arrive in La ciotqt a bit later

26/07/2024, 16:59 - Théodore Bedos: No one is allowed here
26/07/2024, 17:09 - Théodore Bedos: It's crazy that they are not allowing anyone to just see from the side. It's all blocked. Only people with paying seats can see. I find it unbelievable!
26/07/2024, 17:11 - Théodore Bedos: Just so that they can sell seated tickets for 1500£ minimum, they don't let anyone else seeing it. The Olympics should be for everyone
26/07/2024, 19:13 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/07/2024, 23:52 - Gracou: Have u actually watched from there?

27/07/2024, 09:26 - Théodore Bedos: It was very good
27/07/2024, 09:27 - Théodore Bedos: The final bit where they light up the final olympic flame was very very nice

27/07/2024, 22:49 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know babe, it's going to make me drive 7h30 instead of 5h30 until I pick you up
27/07/2024, 22:49 - Théodore Bedos: Can you send me Ana's address so that I can check exactly
27/07/2024, 22:50 - Gracou: Localisation en direct partagée
27/07/2024, 22:55 - Théodore Bedos: Don't know what to say
27/07/2024, 23:59 - Gracou: Well it would be helpful to know what you think x
28/07/2024, 01:00 - Théodore Bedos: Well, I told that if you were going to see the girls I would like you to meet me on the way to the south because gap is a pain to go to and I don't want to do 7h30 of driving by myself. 
But you know that if you ask me to come pick you up in Gap I would do it anyway. 
So I don't really like that you are asking me this
28/07/2024, 01:03 - Gracou: Well I’m not asking you to do that especially it’s just I have looked at the google drive thingy and the trains and it’s basically the same amount of time it seems?
28/07/2024, 01:05 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
28/07/2024, 01:06 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
28/07/2024, 01:07 - Théodore Bedos: It's not a huge difference, but still it's 1h30 extra and I would be doing 2h more by myself.
28/07/2024, 01:07 - Gracou: I Will go to wherever you ask me to go to
28/07/2024, 01:08 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks, is it difficult for you to go to the train station in Gap?
28/07/2024, 01:08 - Gracou: I can make it there
28/07/2024, 01:10 - Théodore Bedos: I'll just come pick you up in fouillouse
28/07/2024, 01:13 - Gracou: No you don’t have to, I can get on a train
28/07/2024, 01:13 - Gracou: Why are you awake?

28/07/2024, 01:23 - Théodore Bedos: I'll just come to fouillouse, it's going to be complicate if ever I am late mad you have to wait for me in Grenoble.
28/07/2024, 01:24 - Théodore Bedos: You'll just owe me some cuddles and gratouillies

08/09/2024, 22:04 - Théodore Bedos: Love you lots

10/09/2024, 03:09 - Théodore Bedos: Can you sleep?
10/09/2024, 03:32 - Théodore Bedos: Could we just give us a chance to re-evaluate in 4 or 6 months maybe ? I know that you don't want to keep me hooked and I would want you to not feel like you have a deadline to live what you need to live. But it just doesn't feel right to just let our relationship go like that without a fight.
10/09/2024, 08:20 - Gracou: I will think about it
10/09/2024, 08:32 - Gracou: I miss you

11/09/2024, 23:08 - Gracou: It’s not the best, I have been looking at pictures on my phone which is difficult
11/09/2024, 23:08 - Gracou: I hope you are sleeping well

09/10/2024, 22:36 - Gracou: A bit morbid!
09/10/2024, 22:36 - Gracou: I’m glad it made you happy

09/10/2024, 23:26 - Théodore Bedos: What were you doing up so late yesterday?

13/10/2024, 21:50 - Théodore Bedos: I just wanted to chat with you
13/10/2024, 21:50 - Théodore Bedos: I injured my ankle very badly, and I wanted to hear you tell me off I think
13/10/2024, 23:29 - Théodore Bedos: Why are you treating me like that? It really hurts
14/10/2024, 00:10 - Gracou: I’m really sorry to hear that you broke your ankle - how bad is it?
14/10/2024, 07:58 - Théodore Bedos: I am not talking about my ankle here. Is it bothering you that I messaged you this week?

23/10/2024, 22:58 - Théodore Bedos: It was ok. I played too much video games though
23/10/2024, 22:59 - Théodore Bedos: I am seeing Viktor and Mark for a UFC and Hot Ones wings evening, and then my Sister for lunch on Sunday. So it should be better this weekend

27/10/2024, 19:54 - Théodore Bedos: null
27/10/2024, 19:55 - Gracou: There has just been a football game so there are loads of loud northerners on the train
27/10/2024, 19:56 - Théodore Bedos: My parents just told me that they are separating
27/10/2024, 19:56 - Gracou: Could you hear me at all?
27/10/2024, 19:56 - Gracou: Oh my goodness

27/10/2024, 19:59 - Théodore Bedos: Sorry to bother you with that.   I shouldn't rely on you for that, but there is no one else than you I would want to speak with now
27/10/2024, 19:59 - Gracou: It’s okay
27/10/2024, 19:59 - Gracou: Where are you?
27/10/2024, 19:59 - Théodore Bedos: I am home

27/10/2024, 20:00 - Théodore Bedos: Probably
27/10/2024, 20:02 - Gracou: Okay, drink some water x
27/10/2024, 20:22 - Gracou: null
27/10/2024, 20:23 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks for trying
27/10/2024, 20:23 - Théodore Bedos: I couldn't hear you

28/10/2024, 18:48 - Théodore Bedos: I am glad too, it felt like a 15min call to me
28/10/2024, 21:32 - Gracou: 😁
28/10/2024, 21:32 - Gracou: It was a nice chat
28/10/2024, 21:33 - Gracou: I enjoyed it too
28/10/2024, 21:38 - Théodore Bedos: I saw your Instagram post. I like it, it made me very nostalgic
28/10/2024, 21:38 - Théodore Bedos: I was surprised you didn't post that picture of you at the castle at night instead of the one you posted
28/10/2024, 21:40 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
28/10/2024, 23:10 - Gracou: I wasn’t sure that this one was my best photo
28/10/2024, 23:10 - Gracou: I hope it didn’t upset you, my parents called and told me off about it this evening
28/10/2024, 23:20 - Théodore Bedos: There is something special about you when you look over your shoulder like that
28/10/2024, 23:24 - Théodore Bedos: It's ok. I know that you post on Instagram to not forget about the good times you had, so I was happy to see that these memories made it there
28/10/2024, 23:27 - Gracou: I’m glad, I hoped you would think that
28/10/2024, 23:27 - Gracou: Warning: there are more
28/10/2024, 23:49 - Théodore Bedos: I wanted to ask in the call, why did you cancel your Halloween night out? It sounded like you had an argue with your friends or something you were unhappy with.
29/10/2024, 00:11 - Gracou: No it wasn’t anything like that, Lolly isn’t having a great time with her mental health and she didn’t want to go out in the end and so we all decided to stay in
29/10/2024, 07:43 - Théodore Bedos: That's nice of you. Is it because she can't a job? The software industry is really tough at the moment
29/10/2024, 17:07 - Gracou: Yes, but she probably isn’t applying to enough jobs either, her parents are quite soft on her
29/10/2024, 17:07 - Gracou: It’s a bit tricky
29/10/2024, 18:58 - Théodore Bedos: I see
29/10/2024, 19:01 - Théodore Bedos: I hope she will get better. She is a very joyous person, I'd be sad to hear that she lost that part of her.
31/10/2024, 13:32 - Gracou: Me too, I think she will get through it
31/10/2024, 13:32 - Gracou: Do you think you could send me some of the hello fresh recipes?
31/10/2024, 14:00 - Gracou: OMG MANLY DAD IS BACK
31/10/2024, 19:10 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, which one would you like?
31/10/2024, 19:11 - Théodore Bedos: I was going to give you the credentials of the hello fresh account, but unfortunately they are not giving me access to our past recipes anymore
31/10/2024, 19:12 - Théodore Bedos: And what a badass entry!
02/11/2024, 15:03 - Gracou: Definitely the orange rice
06/11/2024, 11:40 - Théodore Bedos: For 2-3 portions

Ingredients:
- 2-3 chicken breasts
- 400g coconut milk (don't take light)
- 3 garlic gloves
- 40g of ginger (you can use easy ginger or ginger paste)
- 80g tomato puree
- 100-200g of baby spinach (normal spinach works too) (I put around 200 so that I have more veggies and it's more feeling, but the recipe says 120g I think)
- 1 chicken stock 
- Soya sauce 
- 1/2 lime
- Sesame oil

Instructions:

0- Start cooking your rice.

1- Finely chop the garlic and ginger, then dice the chicken.

2 - Eat a pan with sesame oil, once hot, add the chicken. Cook until not pink but not too cook (it's still going to cook a bit with the rest)

3 - add the garlic, the ginger and the tomato purée. Stir actively for 1 min.

4- add the Coco milk and the chicken stock paste. Let it boil and then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 5 min approx until you have a thicker consistency.

5 - Add the spinach a hand full at a time. Stir between each hand.

6- Add a the soya sauce. I don't know the quantity, I just zig zag over it once. Start with not too much, stir then taste and add more as you like.

7 - stop the heat. Squeeze the lemon juice.  And mix.

8 - Serve on the rice. You can  sprinkle some lemon zest on top but usually I am too lazy for it.

Enjoy
06/11/2024, 11:41 - Théodore Bedos: I couldn't find our recipes sheets  🥲
06/11/2024, 20:42 - Gracou: Did you make that recipe up!
06/11/2024, 20:50 - Théodore Bedos: That's how I make the orange rice

09/11/2024, 17:08 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you 😁
09/11/2024, 18:25 - Gracou: First time I’ve got it right 🕺🕺🕺🕺
09/11/2024, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: 👏
13/11/2024, 13:21 - Théodore Bedos: Hey, about that and what I got you for Christmas. I just wanted you to know, that I haven't spent exactly as much as last year for example. I was going to get you a smaller something else as well to complete it. So I don't want you to think that you have to spend a lot.
13/11/2024, 13:23 - Théodore Bedos: Also, I don't feel like you owe me anything by the way. It's been a while that I have spent this money, it doesn't feel like a spent anymore in my mind.
13/11/2024, 13:24 - Théodore Bedos: I just want you to have it.
13/11/2024, 13:24 - Gracou: That’s very sweet thanks for letting me know
13/11/2024, 13:24 - Gracou: I thought you had bought the really expensive shoes and I was stressing a bit
13/11/2024, 13:25 - Gracou: But of course I will be getting you a gift
13/11/2024, 13:25 - Gracou: I’m struggling to know what to get you though actually!
13/11/2024, 13:25 - Théodore Bedos: That's what I thought, so I felt like clarifying it.
13/11/2024, 13:26 - Théodore Bedos: I don't really feel like giving you a list or anything. If you really feel like you want to offer me something, just go with anything that you want me to have.
13/11/2024, 13:26 - Théodore Bedos: But you don't owe me anything
13/11/2024, 13:26 - Gracou: Yes I think that’s fair enough
13/11/2024, 13:26 - Gracou: I suppose a list is weird in this situation
13/11/2024, 13:28 - Gracou: Are you doing well?
13/11/2024, 13:32 - Théodore Bedos: I can't lie to you, I am having a rough time, but I can see progress.
13/11/2024, 13:35 - Théodore Bedos: What about you?
13/11/2024, 21:28 - Gracou: I’m sorry to hear it’s rough
13/11/2024, 21:28 - Gracou: I’m doing good
13/11/2024, 21:42 - Théodore Bedos: Have you finished JJK season 2?
15/11/2024, 14:52 - Théodore Bedos: Hey, I have been wanting to tell you. Kavinski, Angele and Phoenix have released the Olympics closing ceremony version of Nightcall. I think you'll like it.
15/11/2024, 14:54 - Gracou: I was just watching an episode of one piece and I’m certain you would have cried hahaha
15/11/2024, 14:54 - Gracou: When did they release it?
15/11/2024, 14:54 - Gracou: Yes I have - it was great
15/11/2024, 14:58 - Théodore Bedos: Mid September I think
15/11/2024, 14:59 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
15/11/2024, 15:01 - Théodore Bedos: I don't wanna spoil... When they evacuate the bridge?
15/11/2024, 15:03 - Théodore Bedos: Your favourite part/fight?
15/11/2024, 15:06 - Gracou: That’s a cool cover picture
15/11/2024, 15:06 - Gracou: Good question I’m not sure - what was urs?
15/11/2024, 15:07 - Gracou: Yes when Merry comes back, and then at the begining of the next episode when they are just in the merry and robin says thank you to the crew
15/11/2024, 15:07 - Gracou: I haven’t finished that ep yet tho
15/11/2024, 15:21 - Théodore Bedos: Yes I would have cried 200%
15/11/2024, 15:22 - Théodore Bedos: I can't believe you haven't had at least a tear
15/11/2024, 15:25 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
15/11/2024, 15:27 - Théodore Bedos: Probably this. Or Gojo Vs Toji when Gojo loss
15/11/2024, 15:45 - Gracou: 😂😂😂
15/11/2024, 15:46 - Gracou: This was good and also when he was fighting half dead
15/11/2024, 15:46 - Gracou: WhT did u think when manly dad killed himself
15/11/2024, 15:47 - Gracou: When geto absorbed stitch face I was like oh dear
15/11/2024, 15:48 - Gracou: And I liked when itidori was a wolf when scar face was dying
15/11/2024, 15:49 - Théodore Bedos: Yes that was great! I was gonna say that originally
15/11/2024, 15:50 - Théodore Bedos: Yes it was touching but it came just after manly dad Vs the Kung Fu rabbits. And that was just 😍🤯
15/11/2024, 15:51 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
15/11/2024, 15:52 - Théodore Bedos: Yes! That was very satisfying when Itadori goes completely berserk on him
15/11/2024, 15:54 - Théodore Bedos: I loved the season because there was such a strong hunter hunter inspiration. It's not who is the strongest who win the fight but who understands the other's ability the best.
15/11/2024, 15:55 - Théodore Bedos: The fight with the blood guy in the toilet was brilliant as well.
18/11/2024, 22:04 - Gracou: I sort of can’t believe he is dead to be honest
18/11/2024, 22:04 - Gracou: Hahaha this is such a good gig and I like that u call them kung fu rabbits
18/11/2024, 22:04 - Gracou: But didn’t he not even realise he was fighting his dad which was crazy
18/11/2024, 22:05 - Gracou: You really think that was from hunter hunter?
18/11/2024, 22:05 - Gracou: I rlly like that he’s his brother actually I think it’s a cool twist
18/11/2024, 22:06 - Gracou: I Hope they don’t waste his character by killing him off rlly quickly
19/11/2024, 12:48 - Gracou: Nami’s boobs suddenly turn humungous after enies lobby! What the heck!
21/11/2024, 22:29 - Théodore Bedos: Yes, it's crazy to throw away such a cool character
21/11/2024, 22:30 - Théodore Bedos: I think there is inspiration, yes
21/11/2024, 22:32 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know if it's actually is brother... I don't think I understood what happened really. Maybe he just lost too much blood and was hallucinating??
25/11/2024, 23:33 - Gracou: Yeah ::
25/11/2024, 23:34 - Gracou: Oh interesting I didn’t see that
25/11/2024, 23:35 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
25/11/2024, 23:36 - Gracou: Not sure if that was obvious
25/11/2024, 23:36 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
25/11/2024, 23:39 - Théodore Bedos: Interesting I never thought about that. Strange that it appears only against these 2 who fought Hitadori.
25/11/2024, 23:40 - Théodore Bedos: Also I don't know why the blood guy doesn't look at all like his 2 brothers that Hitadori killed
25/11/2024, 23:42 - Gracou: Hmm?
25/11/2024, 23:42 - Gracou: I don’t understand
25/11/2024, 23:44 - Théodore Bedos: Are you happy with the retainers?
25/11/2024, 23:52 - Gracou: I am just using them for teeth whitening at night, I don’t have much longer left now as I’m supposed to finish on Thursday - my teeth are visibly whiter but not not crazy white which is good :)
25/11/2024, 23:52 - Gracou: I’m glad I’m not doing Invisalign tbh bc it’s annoying to have them in all the time
25/11/2024, 23:52 - Gracou: What are you going to do for your birthday?
26/11/2024, 00:06 - Théodore Bedos: Seems nice, do you recommend it? Was it expensive?
26/11/2024, 00:09 - Théodore Bedos: I am currently in Germany for work, I am leaving Wednesday on my birthday to go to London for a conference until Friday. So on Wednesday I should see Viktor and Marc and go to top secret comedy.
26/11/2024, 00:11 - Théodore Bedos: I just arrived in Germany, I am in the middle of nowhere. I took trains from Amsterdam, half of them got cancelled. At some points I was in an underground tunnel in the forest at 00:30 trying to reach a station.
26/11/2024, 00:11 - Théodore Bedos: I just arrived and look at my room 😂😂 I have a double bed and a single duvet 😂
26/11/2024, 00:12 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
26/11/2024, 00:14 - Gracou: It was about £350 which is a bit expensive to be honest, I would definitely need to give a review after i see how long it lasts
26/11/2024, 00:15 - Gracou: But to be honest all of the whitening options seem really expensive
26/11/2024, 00:15 - Gracou: Are you thinking of going it? Your teeth are quite white?
26/11/2024, 00:15 - Gracou: That sounds really fun - I haven’t been to top secret comedy club in ages
26/11/2024, 00:15 - Gracou: Is it nice to be back in Germany?
26/11/2024, 00:16 - Gracou: That’s funny haha
26/11/2024, 00:30 - Théodore Bedos: Did you take a before picture?
26/11/2024, 00:31 - Théodore Bedos: You think? I thought yours were more white
26/11/2024, 00:32 - Théodore Bedos: So far not much, all I have seen is very very bad trains and train station
26/11/2024, 00:32 - Théodore Bedos: We will see tomorrow after I get some German beers with the colleagues
27/11/2024, 12:24 - Gracou: null
27/11/2024, 15:53 - Théodore Bedos: My mom lost Scottie in Bernières. She was really worried. Then after 2 days, Scottie was found just chilling on a sofa but he was completely messed up, like if he had 5% battery. She realised he was under the sofa for 2 days and either he was stuck or so ill that he couldn't move much. She took him to the vet, and he had 2 stay 48h under watch because he was severely dehydrated. It cost her 500£.
27/11/2024, 18:36 - Gracou: Oh dear
27/11/2024, 18:36 - Gracou: It’s a good thing he dragged himself out
27/11/2024, 18:41 - Théodore Bedos: By the way my parents sold the apartment in Paris, 1.35M. I thought you would be interested
27/11/2024, 18:52 - Gracou: That is really interesting - is that what they wanted for it? If so, congratualtions to them
27/11/2024, 18:55 - Théodore Bedos: I think the initial price when they first advertised it was 1.5-1.6 but knowing my dad I don't think that's what he wanted, I think that's to give him negotiation margin. So I would assume 1.35 is what he had in mind.
27/11/2024, 18:56 - Théodore Bedos: I haven't discussed it with him yet because he was in Russia until yesterday
27/11/2024, 18:56 - Gracou: Oh, on business?
27/11/2024, 18:56 - Théodore Bedos: Yes
27/11/2024, 18:57 - Théodore Bedos: What do you think of the selling price? As a real estate pro, did you expected more or less?
27/11/2024, 18:58 - Gracou: It’s hard to say, the prices in France are very different to the uk - I am sure that as a professional negotiator your dad got a great price
27/11/2024, 19:10 - Théodore Bedos: Mmmm.... That's a bit of a swiss answer
27/11/2024, 23:23 - Gracou: It’s true though
27/11/2024, 23:52 - Gracou: Thanks for letting me know :) I hope your day was better in the end
28/11/2024, 01:13 - Théodore Bedos: It's just weird to think that this Christmas is going to be the last few days I ever spend in this apartment.
30/11/2024, 19:35 - Gracou: Oh wow that is weird, you’re only going home for  a few days?
30/11/2024, 22:53 - Théodore Bedos: I am staying 1 week
05/12/2024, 00:15 - Gracou: I hope you enjoy it regardless - Paris is really nice at Christmas
24/12/2024, 11:07 - Gracou: I’m wishing you and your family a Joyeux Noel 🎄🎅🏻⛄️❄️
24/12/2024, 11:34 - Théodore Bedos: Thank you 🙏 I wish you a great Christmas, a well cooked beef wellington and a mountain of little gifts!
24/12/2024, 11:34 - Gracou: That’s very sweet 😊
24/12/2024, 11:35 - Théodore Bedos: Did you get your big sock already?
24/12/2024, 11:36 - Gracou: No, that’s tomorrow :) I just remembered that your family celebrates today instead
24/12/2024, 11:37 - Gracou: Just letting you know, bampy had a seizure and fell to floor of the bathroom in the middle of the night so I think he will be in hospital all of today. It doesn’t seem like a stroke though and we think he is okay - just need to work out why it happened!
24/12/2024, 11:40 - Théodore Bedos: Omg!! I really hope he will be fine and he can get to enjoy Christmas with his family. Thanks for letting me know, I appreciate it
24/12/2024, 11:41 - Théodore Bedos: It's such a grandfather thing to do, my grandfather did the same at one Christmas in Bernières. He was completely fine after
24/12/2024, 11:41 - Gracou: I thought you might, I would feel the same way if something happened to Mana
24/12/2024, 11:41 - Gracou: Hahaha
24/12/2024, 11:42 - Théodore Bedos: Because it was in the middle of the night, who helped bampy? Was he able to call for help?
24/12/2024, 11:46 - Gracou: Nanny heard him fall over and called an Abu lance
24/12/2024, 11:51 - Théodore Bedos: That's lucky, she could have been sleeping
24/12/2024, 11:52 - Gracou: She was, but I think it must have been a noisy fall
24/12/2024, 11:52 - Gracou: Are you well?
24/12/2024, 11:57 - Théodore Bedos: I am well thank you
24/12/2024, 11:58 - Théodore Bedos: But...
24/12/2024, 11:59 - Théodore Bedos: I am getting hair transplant for Christmas so .....😂😂😂
24/12/2024, 11:59 - Gracou: 😂😂😂
24/12/2024, 12:00 - Théodore Bedos: Some may say it's a sign of not going so well
24/12/2024, 12:00 - Gracou: You are going to have to show me the before and after pictures
24/12/2024, 12:00 - Gracou: Well it was your dad that suggested it right? Or are you not feeling very good about yourself?
24/12/2024, 12:01 - Théodore Bedos: Both
24/12/2024, 12:01 - Gracou: ☹️
24/12/2024, 12:01 - Gracou: Why are you feeling insecure?
24/12/2024, 12:02 - Théodore Bedos: No no, I didn't read the not feeling good about yourself part correctly
24/12/2024, 12:03 - Gracou: You don’t need to feel ashamed for wanting one Theo
24/12/2024, 12:03 - Gracou: I had my tooth done and I don’t feel ashamed
24/12/2024, 12:04 - Gracou: Also it’s a secret but darcy got Botox last week!
24/12/2024, 12:07 - Gracou: You are taking a long time to decide what to say!
24/12/2024, 12:08 - Théodore Bedos: There is a bit of insecurity for sure, but also just being without you is making me rethink/reconsider a few things about my life, including how much I care about having hair
24/12/2024, 12:09 - Théodore Bedos: My parents ask if I wanted something bigger as it was my 25th, I didn't have anything in mind, so I suggested it and obviously my dad jumped on the opportunity to say yes
24/12/2024, 12:10 - Gracou: Is he having it done too?
24/12/2024, 12:10 - Théodore Bedos: No 😂😂😂
24/12/2024, 12:10 - Gracou: Oh hahaha he’s living vicariously through you then
24/12/2024, 12:11 - Théodore Bedos: I am not doing it now by the way. I think I'll do it in England in February
24/12/2024, 12:12 - Théodore Bedos: What about you? Are you happy?
24/12/2024, 12:12 - Gracou: Yes I am
24/12/2024, 12:12 - Gracou: I Hope that isn’t upsetting
24/12/2024, 12:13 - Théodore Bedos: Just a little bit
24/12/2024, 12:13 - Théodore Bedos: It's fine
24/12/2024, 12:13 - Gracou: Are you not happy?
24/12/2024, 12:15 - Théodore Bedos: I am not unhappy
24/12/2024, 12:20 - Théodore Bedos: I am very well, nothing going bad, I am up the hill, I am not unhappy. I just expect more from to call it being happy
24/12/2024, 12:20 - Théodore Bedos: If that makes sense
24/12/2024, 12:23 - Gracou: Yes i understand
24/12/2024, 12:24 - Gracou: I’m just driving so I can’t put a proper response
24/12/2024, 12:41 - Gracou: You will find something that makes you happy ;) it takes time
24/12/2024, 12:42 - Théodore Bedos: Yes for sure, I am not worried
24/12/2024, 12:56 - Gracou: And hopefully being with family makes you happy!
24/12/2024, 13:17 - Théodore Bedos: I appreciate the thought, but you know it's not really Christmas yet. I haven't wished Joyeux Noël to anyone yet. We are celebrating it tomorrow
24/12/2024, 13:46 - Théodore Bedos: Are you expecting a gift in particular?
24/12/2024, 15:22 - Gracou: Oh cool
24/12/2024, 15:23 - Gracou: I am having a bit of money for my teeth that I had done, but the business isn’t very good and my parents are stressed and busy so there won’t be as many gifts this year I think :)
24/12/2024, 15:43 - Théodore Bedos: Oh...
24/12/2024, 15:43 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
24/12/2024, 15:45 - Théodore Bedos: I have bought a charger and I have all these adaptors that I don't need, I can prepare 8 little gifts fo you to make up the number
24/12/2024, 15:45 - Gracou: Hahaha
25/12/2024, 14:24 - Théodore Bedos: Hey, how is Bampy feeling today?
25/12/2024, 15:35 - Gracou: <Médias omis>
25/12/2024, 15:59 - Théodore Bedos: They look good 😀 Thanks for the picture
25/12/2024, 16:02 - Théodore Bedos: You look sunny
25/12/2024, 17:14 - Gracou: Thanks :) I don’t know what sunny means but I hope it’s good!
25/12/2024, 18:26 - Théodore Bedos: You shine
25/12/2024, 18:27 - Théodore Bedos: You shine good vibes, as if you are a little sun in the room that makes everyone happy
25/12/2024, 19:49 - Gracou: I Saïd that to my dad and he said ‘well that’s not true is it’ 😂😂😂
25/12/2024, 20:35 - Théodore Bedos: Is the atmosphere a bit heated? Arguments?
27/12/2024, 13:47 - Théodore Bedos: Look who just passed at the shop...
27/12/2024, 13:47 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
27/12/2024, 13:47 - Théodore Bedos: Can you guess who it is?
27/12/2024, 16:03 - Gracou: Yeah a bit 😂
27/12/2024, 16:03 - Gracou: Parrot man?
27/12/2024, 16:04 - Gracou: It’s not Jonny depp is it
27/12/2024, 17:09 - Théodore Bedos: <Médias omis>
27/12/2024, 17:09 - Gracou: Niiiice
27/12/2024, 17:10 - Gracou: What did Raphael say about him was there a good story
27/12/2024, 17:14 - Théodore Bedos: Apparently he is really sweet, he asks a lot of questions and he gets interested by everything
27/12/2024, 17:14 - Théodore Bedos: My dad is having dinner with him and his friends this evening
27/12/2024, 17:15 - Gracou: Wowww
27/12/2024, 17:15 - Gracou: Is JD speaking french or English?
27/12/2024, 17:16 - Théodore Bedos: He speaks french well
27/12/2024, 17:19 - Gracou: And he just wondered in and asked your dad on a date?
27/12/2024, 17:20 - Théodore Bedos: You know my dad, they probably chatted quite a bit before
27/12/2024, 17:20 - Théodore Bedos: He bought a few things
27/12/2024, 17:22 - Gracou: Expensive ones?
27/12/2024, 17:31 - Gracou: We all guessed from this picture who it was haha
27/12/2024, 17:32 - Théodore Bedos: Impressive
27/12/2024, 17:32 - Théodore Bedos: Small things like a key, a glass and some other stuffs. But my dad was happy because it was things he struggled to sell
27/12/2024, 17:33 - Théodore Bedos: Maybe JD has no taste....
27/12/2024, 17:33 - Gracou: 😂😂😂
01/01/2025, 00:06 - Théodore Bedos: Bonne année 🎉🎉🎉
04/01/2025, 10:59 - Théodore Bedos: Hey, I am planning to go to London one weekend in January to do some painting in the London apartment. Would you like to see each other?
07/01/2025, 16:50 - Gracou: Happy new year :) sorry I’m a week late
07/01/2025, 16:51 - Gracou: It would be nice to see you, but I’m not in london at all in January :/ why are you painting the apartment?
07/01/2025, 17:41 - Théodore Bedos: I am going to have new tenants. It's a good occasion to do some fixes
07/01/2025, 17:44 - Théodore Bedos: That's unfortunate
07/01/2025, 18:55 - Théodore Bedos: What about we meet for a drink in the lovely city of Birmingham?
07/01/2025, 21:23 - Théodore Bedos: I guess that's a bit forced maybe... I am just gonna end up with a buzz cut in February😅 I wished we could arrange to see each other before
07/01/2025, 21:35 - Gracou: Hahahahhaha
07/01/2025, 21:35 - Gracou: You want me to say goodbye to your hair 😂
07/01/2025, 21:36 - Gracou: Are you having the surgery in February?
07/01/2025, 21:38 - Théodore Bedos: I did not think about it that way, but I think that's definitely something my hairline deserves
07/01/2025, 21:39 - Théodore Bedos: I also I have a Christmas present for you and you know that I can be quiet impatient when I have a gift
07/01/2025, 21:39 - Théodore Bedos: 13th of February
07/01/2025, 21:39 - Gracou: Oh wow so soon
07/01/2025, 21:43 - Gracou: I’m really not trying to mess you around it’s just that you know what I’m like and I already have plans on all the weekends until then and I can’t move them
07/01/2025, 21:45 - Théodore Bedos: Don't worry I thought it could be the case
07/01/2025, 21:47 - Gracou: When do you think you will do the painting in london?
07/01/2025, 21:48 - Théodore Bedos: I don't know yet just yet but probably end of Jan, beginning of February
07/01/2025, 21:52 - Théodore Bedos: I can propose you 4 options, maybe one could fit in your schedule:
- if you have planned to go down to Devon maybe we can meet in Exeter, it's close from me.
- I might go see Jim in Nottingham in Jan, I could see you in Manchester if you have half a day free. 
- There is a concert of Justice the 11th and 12th of February, maybe we could go, but it's a Tuesday and Wednesday so that's probably not super doable for you
07/01/2025, 21:53 - Théodore Bedos: The concert is in London
07/01/2025, 23:00 - Gracou: That is only three options 😁
07/01/2025, 23:07 - Gracou: It’s not very possible in January :/ friends are visiting me every weekend
07/01/2025, 23:07 - Gracou: We can still meet in February even if you have a buzz cut :)
07/01/2025, 23:13 - Gracou: https://onepace.net/en
07/01/2025, 23:13 - Gracou: By the way a friend sent me this - in case you ever want to use it!
07/01/2025, 23:18 - Théodore Bedos: I'll use it
07/01/2025, 23:23 - Théodore Bedos: I see, sounds like a fun January
07/01/2025, 23:27 - Théodore Bedos: Are you busy the first or second weekend of February?
07/01/2025, 23:29 - Théodore Bedos: By the way did you have a nice new year eve? Did you book the country side house like last year?
07/01/2025, 23:39 - Gracou: Im visiting london on the 15th
07/01/2025, 23:40 - Gracou: For new year I went to Primrose Hill in london to view the fireworks with the normal friends but less than last time bc a lot of people couldn’t be bothered - was urs good?
07/01/2025, 23:49 - Théodore Bedos: Yeah... Not gonna work. I'll have a really red and scabby skull that week end
07/01/2025, 23:52 - Théodore Bedos: Well let me know if some of your plans change or if you want to come to the concert, I'd invite you
09/01/2025, 00:05 - Gracou: Apart from then I’m not in london until the end of February - but you know I’m not bothered by you having a scabby scull
09/01/2025, 00:06 - Gracou: It’s kind of you to offer to take me to justice
09/01/2025, 00:13 - Théodore Bedos: Are you insinuating that I have a scabby skull in general? 😬😂
09/01/2025, 00:13 - Gracou: Why are you awake it’s past 11pm!
09/01/2025, 00:15 - Théodore Bedos: Because tommorow is my Graduate presentation to the exec and I have created a virtual avatar of the CEO who just retired to answer the Q&A for me. It was lot of work, I just finished it (almost)
09/01/2025, 00:16 - Théodore Bedos: A deep fake basically, with his voice and face
09/01/2025, 00:16 - Gracou: Wow!
09/01/2025, 00:16 - Théodore Bedos: Why are you up so late?
09/01/2025, 00:17 - Gracou: I always am u just didn’t notice bc u were asleep 😂
09/01/2025, 00:17 - Théodore Bedos: No at some point you were worst than me
09/01/2025, 00:17 - Théodore Bedos: I guess it was more when you lived when your parents
09/01/2025, 00:18 - Gracou: Definitely not
09/01/2025, 00:18 - Gracou: Oh yes the parents thing
09/01/2025, 00:18 - Gracou: It wasn’t that I was asleep but I wasn’t allowed to be on the phone
09/01/2025, 00:18 - Théodore Bedos: 😂😂😂😂
09/01/2025, 00:19 - Théodore Bedos: Oh god!! It must have been not been fun to have to feel like a child again
09/01/2025, 00:19 - Théodore Bedos: Seriously
09/01/2025, 00:20 - Gracou: No it wasn’t ideal 😁
09/01/2025, 00:21 - Théodore Bedos: Are you still loving your new place ?
09/01/2025, 00:23 - Gracou: Yeah it just gets better and better to be honest - this evening I picked up a digital piano from marketplace
09/01/2025, 00:28 - Théodore Bedos: Super cool!! I guess it was a good deal?
09/01/2025, 00:28 - Théodore Bedos: Is it a new resolution to restart playing piano?
09/01/2025, 00:34 - Gracou: It was a pretty good deal and of course I have learned to negotiate from a top negotiating family
09/01/2025, 00:34 - Gracou: It’s not a resolution, but I’m teaching Adam to play and realised I will need to practise in order to stay better than him or else I will get fired 🙂
09/01/2025, 00:35 - Gracou: I need to go to sleep now but wishing you good luck tomorrow! This is your big moment that you worked hard for - trust in all that hard work and enjoy it 😊
09/01/2025, 00:36 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks
09/01/2025, 00:37 - Théodore Bedos: Have you practised your ukulele much? Because I can play over the rainbow now 😎
09/01/2025, 00:38 - Théodore Bedos: Good night
09/01/2025, 00:38 - Gracou: Oh wow, congrats! I was practicing before Niamh moved in and then I didn’t want to make her listen :/ the piano I bought is digital though so I can practice with headphones😎
09/01/2025, 00:39 - Gracou: Good night and good luck
09/01/2025, 15:19 - Gracou: How did it go?
09/01/2025, 15:20 - Théodore Bedos: It went really well, I am still the wonderkid 😅
09/01/2025, 15:23 - Théodore Bedos: You wouldn't believe it, my car wouldn't start when I left, because of the snow my battery died, no taxi would come, so I had to run and hitch hike but no one would take me. So I saw a builder who was putting back his tools in his van, and I asked him if by any chance he was going to Trowbridge and I could come with him. He drove me all the way to the office speeding like crazy and I arrived 20sec before they called me. I was shaking because of the adrenaline for the first 2 min of my presentation
09/01/2025, 15:25 - Théodore Bedos: And then one of the execs gave me a lift back and I just got home. The exec had just had hair transplant 😂
09/01/2025, 16:00 - Gracou: What a whirlwind! Congratulations - I’m glad it went well :) well done it sounds like a trial!
09/01/2025, 22:21 - Théodore Bedos: Thanks
10/01/2025, 19:52 - Théodore Bedos: I have asked if I could move my operation to a later date and it's going to be possible. Is there really no possibility to see each other before?
10/01/2025, 19:53 - Théodore Bedos: I know Jan is booked for you but what about 1st or 8th of February?
11/01/2025, 01:16 - Théodore Bedos: *it's not possible
15/01/2025, 13:03 - Gracou: Hi Theo sorry for not answering your message for a while
15/01/2025, 13:06 - Gracou: I don’t think you need to worry so much about seeing me before your operation don’t stress :) I can see you when your operation is done!
19/01/2025, 20:47 - Théodore Bedos: Hey, I am not stressing, I would have just preferred before, I think that's understandable. But anyway,  I can see you end of February or beginning of March if you like, let me know
19/01/2025, 20:48 - Théodore Bedos: I just watched a Ghibli movie called Porco Rosso. It's short and sweet, I recommend it. And the music is 👌👌👌
25/01/2025, 14:54 - Gracou: Thanks for the recommendation 👍
29/01/2025, 14:13 - Théodore Bedos: Hi, just letting you know in case your plans have changed, I will be in London this Saturday and Sunday
29/01/2025, 14:32 - Gracou: Hi Theo, I am actually going down to Devon because Harper has passed away :)
29/01/2025, 14:37 - Théodore Bedos: Oh nooo! How is Roger feeling?
29/01/2025, 14:38 - Gracou: He is not doing great, so I’m going down tonight
29/01/2025, 14:38 - Gracou: I Hope u have fun with victor this weekend!
29/01/2025, 14:39 - Théodore Bedos: It's funny you said that because I was gonna see Alex but he just cancelled on me 2min ago, so I'll probably go see Viktor
29/01/2025, 14:40 - Théodore Bedos: Sucks, I hope he is gonna get better with you around
29/01/2025, 14:40 - Théodore Bedos: Is it normal death? Or an accident?
29/01/2025, 14:46 - Gracou: I don’t know Alex
29/01/2025, 14:46 - Gracou: Her heart had issues and she had started collapsing, she was put down by the vet bc nanny didn’t want her to suffer for longer than necessary
29/01/2025, 14:48 - Théodore Bedos: Alex Benoit
29/01/2025, 14:49 - Théodore Bedos: How do you feel?
29/01/2025, 18:23 - Gracou: I am glad she didn’t suffer for too long like some dogs, or didn’t need loads of surgery and at 13 years I do strongly feel that she had the best life we could have given her :) and I’m grateful to have had her
29/01/2025, 21:56 - Théodore Bedos: Glad you feel like that
29/01/2025, 22:09 - Théodore Bedos: I'll always remember the first time I met Harper, we went to the beach for a walk, and I had her on my lap the whole trip while you drove. She was so so sweet. Also you could tell she really liked you. When you jackass went swimming in your underwear in the freezing water, she was shaking because she was worried for you. She was the only little dog that wasn't annoying, she was great
29/01/2025, 22:10 - Théodore Bedos: I'll have a little prayer for her
01/02/2025, 11:05 - Gracou: Hahaha that’s sweet
01/02/2025, 11:05 - Gracou: Thank you
01/02/2025, 12:15 - Théodore Bedos: I mean it
04/02/2025, 23:02 - Théodore Bedos: Hey! I’ve changed my WhatsApp number to +447383484747. Please save it!
10/02/2025, 19:32 - Gracou: Oh that’s a shame, it has deleted all of our previous messages
10/02/2025, 19:39 - Théodore Bedos: It hasn't for me, I think I can export the history of discussions and send it to you, if you want
10/02/2025, 19:50 - Gracou: Okay yes please
10/02/2025, 19:51 - Gracou: Are you feeling okay after your operation?

18/02/2025, 00:13 - Gracou: Is everything okay? Did you have a problem with the surgery?
18/02/2025, 11:50 - Théodore Bedos: Oh no, don't worry, it went very well actually
18/02/2025, 11:51 - Théodore Bedos: I just felt like having a chat with you but I didn't want to disturb your plans by calling abruptly
18/02/2025, 17:24 - Gracou: Im glad it went well, I can call you this evening - I’m assuming your at the gym at the moment
18/02/2025, 17:24 - Gracou: Or leaving for the gym

18/02/2025, 20:33 - Théodore Bedos: Before/after
18/02/2025, 20:37 - Gracou: Wow
18/02/2025, 20:38 - Gracou: It’s interesting to see how far back your hair was thinning
18/02/2025, 20:38 - Gracou: Actually your bald head isn’t that bad
18/02/2025, 20:38 - Gracou: I didn’t ask if it was painful
18/02/2025, 20:56 - Théodore Bedos: Every one told me that! I was surprised too. It's funny, could have been a pretty bald man
18/02/2025, 20:57 - Théodore Bedos: It's alright, Bedoses don't feel pain 😬😎
